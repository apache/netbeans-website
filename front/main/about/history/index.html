<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NetBeans started as a student project (originally called Xelfi) in the Czech
Republic, in 1996. The goal was to write a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delphi_%28IDE%29">Delphi</a>-like Java IDE (Integrated
Development Environment) in Java.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Xelfi was the first Java IDE written in Java, with its first pre-releases in</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="1997">
<li>
<p>Xelfi was a fun project to work on, especially since the Java IDE space
was uncharted territory at that time.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<img src="../../_images/about/nb-history-1.png" alt="nb history 1">
</div>
<div class="title">Here you see the original group of students who constituted the original NetBeans Team</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The project attracted enough interest that the students, once they graduated,
decided that they could market it as a commercial product selling it as
shareware. Soliciting resources from friends and relatives for a website, they
tried to form a company around it.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_xelfi"><a class="anchor" href="#_xelfi"></a>Xelfi</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Soon after, they were contacted by Roman Stanek, at the time a Director of Operation
in an IT company, that wanted to build his own company and was looking for
talented programmers. He was looking for a good idea to invest in, and
discovered Xelfi. He met with the founders; they hit it off, and a business was
born.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_netbeans_network_java_beans"><a class="anchor" href="#_netbeans_network_java_beans"></a>NetBeans = Network + Java Beans</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original business plan was to develop network-enabled JavaBeans components.
<a href="http://wiki.apidesign.org/wiki/User:JaroslavTulach">Jaroslav Tulach</a>, who
designed the IDE&#8217;s basic architecture, came up with the name <strong>NetBeans</strong> (from
Network and Java Beans) to describe what the components would do. The IDE would
be the way to deliver them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When the specification for Enterprise Java Beans came out, it made more sense
to work with the standard for such components than to compete with it, but the
name stuck.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the spring of 1999, NetBeans DeveloperX2 was released, adopting the
<code>javax.swing.<strong></code> package names from the previous <code>com.sun.swing.</strong></code> ones.
NetBeans was the first tool in on the market to support these new package
names, and that increased a lot the awareness of NetBeans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The performance improvements that came in JDK 1.3, released in the fall of 1999,
made NetBeans a viable choice for development tools. By the summer of 1999, the
team was hard at work re-architecting DeveloperX2 into the more modular
NetBeans that forms the basis of the software today.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_first_modular_architecture"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_first_modular_architecture"></a>The First Modular Architecture</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Along the way, an interesting thing happened. People began building
applications using the NetBeans IDE&#8217;s platform, together with their own
plugins, often creating applications that were not development tools at all. In
fact, this turned out to have quite a market.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Later, in 2000 and 2001, a lot of work went into stripping out pieces that made
the assumption that an application built on NetBeans was an IDE, so that the
platform would be a generic desktop application suitable to any purpose. This
work turned out to be healthy for the codebase of the IDE as well, encouraging
a clean API design and a separation of concerns. This is the reason why
some of the modules of NetBeans are called <code>org.openide</code>.</p>

<h2 id="_the_sun_era_open_source"><a class="anchor" href="#_the_sun_era_open_source"></a>The Sun era: open source</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Something else was afoot in the summer of 1999. Sun Microsystems wanted better
Java development tools, and had become interested in NetBeans. It was a dream
come true for the NetBeans team. NetBeans would become the flagship tool set of
the maker of Java itself!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By the Fall, with the next generation of NetBeans Developer in beta, a deal was
struck. Sun Microsystems had also acquired another tools company, Forté, at the
same time, and decided to rename NetBeans to Forté for Java. The name NetBeans
was dropped&#8230;&#8203; for a while.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>During the acqusition, the young developers who had been involved in
open-source projects for most of their programming careers, mentioned the idea
of open-sourcing NetBeans. Fast forward to less than six months later, the
decision was made that NetBeans would be open sourced.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While Sun had contributed considerable amounts of code to open source projects
over the years, this was Sun&#8217;s first sponsored open source project, one in
which Sun would be paying for the site and handling the infrastructure. The
very first decision made was that it sounded logical to call the new site:
NetBeans.org.</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In June 2000, the initial netbeans.org web site was launched.
The years that followed focused on continual enhancements from release to
release, as described in the section below.</p>

<h3 id="_from_netbeans_3_2_to_netbeans_3_6"><a class="anchor" href="#_from_netbeans_3_2_to_netbeans_3_6"></a>From NetBeans 3.2 to NetBeans 3.6</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first year (through NetBeans 3.2), the project spent trying to find its
feet. The next few years involved learning about what worked in terms of
open-source processes. (In the first two years, the development process was so
open that more time was spent debating than implementing.)</p>

</div>
<div class="title">NetBeans 3.6 structured the projects as filesystems</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The growing pains paid off. With NetBeans 3.5, huge strides in performance were
made, and tests and processes put in place to prevent regressions. With 3.6,
the windowing system and property sheet were reimplemented, and the user
interface cleaned up tremendously.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_netbeans_4"><a class="anchor" href="#_netbeans_4"></a>NetBeans 4</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NetBeans 4, released in December 2004, was a complete change in the way the IDE
worked. A new project system not only revamped the user experience, but also
made it possible to replace infrastructure that had held the NetBeans back.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The release introduced a project system based on Apache Ant, added JDK 1.5 Support
and had initial support for mobility projects.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NetBeans 5.5 (october, 2006) and 5.5.1 (may, 2007) supported the Sun Java
System Application Server PE 9 and 9.1 (Glassfish) as well as Java EE 5 API compliance

<h3 id="_netbeans_6"><a class="anchor" href="#_netbeans_6"></a>NetBeans 6</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>NetBeans 6 (december, 2007) focused on improved developer productivity through a rewritten,
smarter and faster editor, together with the integration of external NetBeans
products into one IDE.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In August, 2010, NetBeans 6.9.1 was released with <a href="https://www.osgi.org/">OSGi support</a>,
bundling the <a href="https://felix.apache.org/">Apache Felix OSGi container</a>. It also
supported <a href="https://openjfx.io/">JavaFX 1.3.1</a>, was Java EE 6 compliant and

<p>Releases from NetBeans 7.2 (january, 2012) to NetBeans 7.4 (october, 2015) continued
