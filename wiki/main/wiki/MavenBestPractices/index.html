<p>In this article you will learn how to import, create and work with Apache Maven
based projects in NetBeans IDE. To quote the <a href="https://maven.apache.org/">Maven project site</a>, "Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool.
Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a
project&#8217;s build, reporting and documentation from a central piece of
information."</p>

<p>The NetBeans IDE can automatically recognize any existing Apache Maven project. If you have such a project, just use the Open Project dialog (to be invoked via Ctrl-Shift-O keyboard shortcut, icon in the toolbar or the File/Open project menu item). All the recognized Maven projects should be marked by the Maven project type icon. If you select such folder in the file chooser, you get the project&#8217;s name and a list of subprojects on the right hand side.</p>

<p>As you can see in the picture above, the project name for Maven-based projects
is composed of 2 elements: the POM &lt;name&gt; element (if not present, then
&lt;artifactId&gt; element) and the project packaging in brackets. In this example
the packaging is maven-plugin. That means the resulting output of the project
is a plugin for Maven itself. The most common packagings are "jar", "war",
"ejb", and "pom". Depending on the packaging of the project the IDE will
automatically change the UI appearance of the opened project. Thus if your
project is a .war project, then web application specific features get enabled
for such Maven project, such as the possibility to deploy to an application
server, web application specific file templates, etc.</p>

<td class="content">
For users of the standard Ant-based projects there is one important
difference in Maven projects with regard to what "Required project" means. For
Ant-based projects, the project&#8217;s classpath is composed of libraries (as
defined in the IDE&#8217;s Library Manager), custom jars and folders and of projects
that the current project depends on. Such a project needs to be compiled before
the current project etc. Maven is missing such a notion and the classpath is
composed exclusively of dependencies that are uniquely identified and are to be
present in a local or remote repository. Therefore one cannot explicitly
declare that the project depends on another project and that one has to be
compiled and packaged before the current one. However for a set of projects
that has to be compiled and packaged together, a "pom" packaged project
aggregates the build by listing them as modules. A project with modules is
known as a multimodule, or aggregator project. Modules are projects that this
POM lists, and are executed as a group. The Maven projects in NetBeans lists
these modules as "Required Projects". So you will only get the required
projects list populated for Maven projects with "pom" packaging that have
modules defined.

You can exploit this behavior to easily define project groups
(File/Project Group/New Group&#8230;&#8203; menu item). In the dialog that adds new
project groups, select the "Project and All Required Projects" option and add
the root POM with definitions of modules that are part of the aggregated build.
By switching to this project, you get all relevant projects opened instantly
and the project group is managed by the content of your POM, therefore you
always get an up-to-date list of the relevant projects.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your project contains generated source roots that need to appear in the
project&#8217;s source path, please make sure that the Maven plugin generating the
sources generates them in the target/generated-sources/&lt;toolname&gt; directory
where &lt;toolname&gt; is folder specific to the Maven plugin used and acts as source
root for the generated sources. Most common maven plugins currently follow this
pattern in the default configuration. If you open the project and the  sources
are not generated yet, you will get compilation errors in classes that use the
generated content. Please do a build of the project and the classpath and
editor highlighting should be refreshed. Alternatively running just the "mvn
generate-sources" build phase should be sufficient.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apart from working with existing projects, the IDE also offers a way to create
new Maven based projects from scratch. The projects are generated using
maven-archetype-plugin.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="../../_images/wiki/Create_MavenBestPractices.png" alt="Create MavenBestPractices">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create a new project, invoke the File/New Project menu item, the action in
toolbar or press Ctrl-Shift-N shortcut. In the list of available project types
select the "Maven" category and select the first project template named "Maven
Project". Hit Next button.  On the next panel you will be presented with the
available Archetypes. Archetype is a Maven term for what is otherwise called a
"project template" in the IDE. The list contains a few hardwired simple
archetypes to get you started fast. You can however enter any archetype you
want. If you have used Maven archetypes before and have some in your local
repository, the list should include your favorite archetypes as well. As you
create new projects from archetypes, the list keeps updating and offering you
the archetypes you have used before in a privileged position. If you don&#8217;t want
to use a particular archetype anymore, you can remove it from the list. It will
be also removed from the local repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If NetBeans knows about the content of remote Maven repositories (more on the
new remote repositories feature later in the article) it will present them in
an expandable tree at the end of the list. There you can browse for all known
archetypes and pick the exact version you want. The IDE will however suggest
the latest version of a given archetype at the top level of the expandable
tree.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you have selected your archetype, the next panel will let you customize
the properties of the new project. These properties will be passed to the maven
archetype plugin which creates the new project. If the execution succeeds, the
created project(s) gets opened in the IDE.</p>

<p><code>NetBeans 6.7</code>: In 6.7, we&#8217;ve added 3 new project wizards that let you easily create a Maven based Web, Ejb and Ear projects. The wizards let you pick the J2EE level and the resulting project will be very close to what the standard Ant based projects generate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>NetBeans 6.8, 6.9</code> In 6.8 and 6.9, the New Project wizards were enhanced to enable the creation of new Maven NetBeans Platform applications, Maven NetBeans modules and Maven OSGi bundles. The option to support OSGi dependencies was added to New Project wizards in 6.9. All specialized wizards can be found under the Maven category of the New Project wizard.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just like Ant based projects in NetBeans use Ant to perform tasks like Run project, Test project or Debug Single File, the Maven based projects use execution of Maven goals to achieve the tasks at hand. The advantage behind the concept is that your IDE action will always perform the required steps as you have defined them in your project&#8217;s POM. Additionally it will do so without changing your project pom.xml file in most cases. What happens when you perform for example "Run Project" action on your project largely depends on what project&#8217;s packaging. If it&#8217;s a jar project, you will be prompted for a main class to run, if it&#8217;s a war or ejb packaging you will have to associate an application server. That will be then used as deployment target your web application. Some basic actions like "Build project" or "Clean project" are defined for all packagings.</p>

<h3 id="_configurations"><a class="anchor" href="#_configurations"></a>Configurations</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Configurations is a new additional mechanism to further extend the
customization of your project&#8217;s execution and loading. It&#8217;s using the similar
UI as the standard Java SE project type. However it&#8217;s disabled by default for
Maven projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To enable it and customize it, right click on the project node and select
"Properties" or use the File/Project Properties main menu item to invoke the
Project properties dialog. On the left hand side, select the panel named
"Configurations". The panel allows to enable and disable the configurations
feature. When enabled all project&#8217;s profiles serve as configurations, however
you can create new custom ones as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And what does the configuration bring to your project anyway?</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>It loads the project in the IDE with the profile(s) associated with the configuration. That way you can get a different set of dependencies or different set of submodules loaded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Every action triggered with the configuration will have it&#8217;s profile(s) also activated for building, running or debugging the application. Thus you can have alternate setup for various plugins and easily switch between them.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Once configurations are enabled, other panels in the Project properties dialog (currently Actions panel for all project packagings and the Run panel for "jar" packaging) add a combobox with existing configurations and let you customize the IDE actions on a per configuration basis. For example each configuration can run the project with different main class setup. Or with different parameters passed into the main class.</p>

<p>Once enabled, the activated configuration can be switched by accessing the popup menu of the project. Right click the project node and select "Set Configuration" menu item. From the list of existing configurations, select the one you want to activate. If your project is setup to be the main project in the IDE (it&#8217;s name is shown in bold letters), you can also quickly switch configurations using a combo box in the toolbar. Please note that due to a bug in NetBeans 6.1, the toolbar editor will not immediately appear for your main project after enabling configurations. A workaround is to restart the IDE or set a different project as main and then set it back to the old project.</p>

<p>The web or enterprise application is run by deploying to an application server.
Unlike the standard Ant based projects, Maven projects don&#8217;t have an
application server associated by default. Therefore before you can run or debug
a web application, you need to associate the project with a server. Please make
sure you have a server registered first. Then right click on the project node
and select "Properties" or use the File/Project Properties main menu item to
invoke the Project properties dialog. Select the Run panel (applies to war, ejb
and ear maven packaging) and select the application server you want to deploy
to. There is additional difference to Ant based projects. None of the jars in
the application server end up on your project&#8217;s compilation classpath. Please
make sure you add all necessary binary dependencies yourself, don&#8217;t forget that
jars that are part of the application server shall not be bundled with the war
file. Setting dependency scope to "provided" handles that.</p>

When you select the application server for your project, a property named
"netbeans.hint.deploy.server" is added to your POM. The property is harmless
for the Maven build and it eases the setup for your colleagues that checkout
the project from version control. If they have an instance of the same type of
server registered in their IDE, it gets automatically assigned to the project.
No more setup for them. If for some reason you don&#8217;t like the property in the
POM, you can move it to the "netbeans-private" profile in the profiles.xml file
(resides next to your pom.xml and is easily accessible from the "Project Files"
node of your project). The IDE will recognize your preference and when you
update the deployment server later, it writes the changes to profiles.xml file
instead.

the Maven support will attempt to identify the web framework jars and add
appropriate dependency elements in the project POM. However not always can the
binaries be identified. In such a case, temporary artifact identification is
created along with a temporary file:// protocol based repository. The user is
encouraged to identify the jars manually and upload them to the company&#8217;s own

<p>Let&#8217;s start by opening the POM file for your project. Expand the project&#8217;s node
the Projects View component. Find the subnode named "Project Files" and expand
it as well. The project files driving your project are residing there. You
always get the pom.xml file as that one is essential for any Maven Project.
There are 2 other files appearing eventually.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IDE has knowledge about the local repository content (populated by locally
built projects from remote repositories) and also about about some content of
some remote repositories. By default at least about the
<a href="https://repo1.maven.org/maven2">central repository</a>. Among other things it
also knows about what classes are used in the artifacts in the repository. The
hint makes use of that information and is capable of finding artifacts in
repositories that contain any unknown class or interface.</p>

You can use this feature as a quick and easy way of adding dependencies to
your project. However the assumption is that you know a name of a class from

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An important part of your Maven based projects is managing it&#8217;s classpath
dependencies. Dependency management is one of the features of Maven that is
best known to users. There is not much difficulty in managing dependencies for
a single a project, but when you start getting into dealing with multi-module
projects and applications that consist of tens or hundreds of modules this is
where Maven can help you a great deal in maintaining a high degree of control
and stability. Check detailed information on Apache Maven
<a href="https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-dependency-mechanism.html">dependency mechanism</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The IDE lists the project dependencies under one or more subnodes of your
project&#8217;s node. It will list the compilation dependencies under "Libraries"
node, runtime dependencies under "Runtime libraries" and the dependencies
required to compile and run your tests under "Test Libraries". Please note that
the Runtime and Test Libraries nodes will only be visible if the project has
applicable dependency entries to save display space for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>NetBeans 7.0:</code> All "Libraries" nodes as part of Maven projects were renamed into "Dependencies".</p>

<p>When you expand the Libraries node you get a flat listing of your project&#8217;s
dependencies. The direct dependencies (listed in your POM) are in the
beginning, transitive ones are at the back and have a desaturated icon to make
it obvious they were pulled by one (or more) of your direct dependencies. Every
dependency also has icon annotations on the right side of the icon that show if
the dependency has javadoc and sources available locally. That&#8217;s useful for
code completion, debugging and other IDE features. The Libraries node provides
popup menu actions for retrieval of sources and javadocs. However please note
that some artifacts in central repository don&#8217;t have these present.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To download and attach source packages from the maven repository, right-click
on the "Libraries" node and select "Download All Library Sources".  This can be
done from the "Test Libraries" and "Runtime Libraries" nodes as well.  Once the
source packages are downloaded, you can drill down to a particular class and
double-clicking it will open the corresponding source code.</p>

If you open a project that other projects depend on, the icon in other
projects changes to a "maven project" icon to denote that the IDE knows about
link between the projects. However such a link is only established when the
groupId, artifactId and version all match in the dependency and project
declaration. Frequently occurring problem is that you change an API signature
in your library project, but the application is not picking up. Often it&#8217;s
caused by the fact that the application is using an older version of the
library artifact. The artifact icon can help you track down these problems.

The difference is subtle. Wile direct dependency gets removed from the

<p>If the dependency&#8217;s metadata provides additional project information, it&#8217;s
possible to: Open project home page or bug tracking system page in your

<p><code>NetBeans 6.7 and newer:</code> The number of dependencies and the complexity of
managing dependencies can be considerable even in smaller projects. The IDE
includes a dependency graph viewer to help you view, manage and fix
dependencies and their conflicts. You can open the viewer by choosing "Show
Dependency Graph" in a project&#8217;s popup menu. The graph displays the structure
of the project&#8217;s dependencies, their paths, and also indicates conflicts and
hints on how such conflicts are typically resolved, such as adding dependency
exclusions or declaring a direct dependency on an artifact. The video

<p>Maven integration is using the <a href="http://nexus.sonatype.org/">Nexus</a> indexing
engine for indexing the local repository. At the same time it can download
zipped Nexus indexes from remote locations. These indexes describe the content
of the remote repositories and allow searching and browsing the content. Many
IDE features make use of these indexes. Some have been already mentioned, like
archetype discovery, code completion in the pom.xml editor, recognition of
library jars for web frameworks etc.  It&#8217;s also possible to browse and manage
the indexes used by the IDE. Open the "Windows" main menu item and select the
"Services" action in the popup. A new component gets opened at the same
position as "Projects", "Files" or "Favourites" components. One of the nodes in
the view is name "Maven repositories" and it lists the currently known
repositories that are browseable and searchable. If you expand the root
repository node, you get a listing of all artifact groupIds present in the
repository, at the next level there are artifactId for the given groupId. The
leaves in the tree and single versions of the given artifact. Small icon
annotations designate if the artifact has sources and javadoc and the text
annotation shows what packaging the artifact is.</p>
