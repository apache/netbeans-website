<p>As part of being involved in Apache, I got the opportunity yesterday to go to Brussels
to attend the European Commission&#8217;s <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/news/ec-open-source-workshops-computing-and-sustainability-2-december-2022-2022-oct-21_en">EC Open Source Workshops - Computing and Sustainability</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_me_and_the_eu">Me and The EU</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Aside from my many years of involvement in the context of open source,
in particular in the context of <a href="../index.html">Apache NetBeans</a> and the <a href="https://foojay.io/">Friends of OpenJDK</a>,
I recently completed my LL.M Masters of Law at the University of Amsterdam in European Union Law
(25 years after completing my LL.B Bachelor of Law in South Africa) especially because,
aside from the academic side of it, I wanted to finally understand how the EU actually works,
with all its institutions, etc, and, though I can&#8217;t say I really have a full grasp on it all yet
(I doubt anyone really does), it was quite moving to be at one of the key pillars of that institution yesterday.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://netbeans.apache.org/blogs/entry/towards-fair-trade-for-foss-pic1.png" alt="towards fair trade for foss pic1">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To describe all the discussions that took place would be impossible,
since I could only physically attend a few of them because many happened in parallel,
it was great to meet several people I knew already from real life and virtually,
such as Simon Phipps, Dirk van Gulik, Roman Shaposhnik, and Jarek Potiuk,
as well as many other new people, there were just too many, from all different organizations,
NGOs, local administrations, governments, etc, from within the EU and beyond.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="https://netbeans.apache.org/blogs/entry/towards-fair-trade-for-foss-pic2.png" alt="towards fair trade for foss pic2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each workshop consisted of a panel that kicked off discussions,
with participants in the room being able to participate, ending with voting
on the most important topics to carry forward and recommend to the European Commission.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_themes">Themes</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A key theme in the workshops I was in was the disconnect and misunderstandings
between the public sector and industries on one side and open source on the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There have been many advances made in the sense that open source is now everywhere,
though it is not everywhere in a balanced way nor supported and sustainable to the extent that is could or should be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I keep seeing an image of the lone maintainer of an open source project in front of me,
late at night, hacking away at code all for free that large enterprises and companies
around the world simply consume and sell as part of their products.
Not only is that an insecure and unsustainable situation there are clear moral and ethical aspects connected to that as well.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_carrot_and_stick">Carrot and Stick</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Clearly there was quite some support for compelling the industry to make public
its dependencies on open source, i.e., be compelled to list on their websites
which open source technologies they&#8217;re using, how they are contributing back to
those projects (and other open source projects), be compelled to push their
changes upstream, and expose/explain what they are doing to enable their developers,
in terms of time and money, to contribute to open source projects that those companies have integrated in one way or another.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A separate idea, not following the legal compliance road, would be some kind of fair trade
accreditation scheme whereby a company would need to comply with certain standards, e.g.,
the above list for example, in order to get accredited with some level of FOSS fair trade certification,
which would be a helpful way for FOSS-aware developers to make the right choices when looking for employment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is simply so much work in IT nowadays that, in fact, companies are now being
interviewed by developers rather than the other way around, and one of the questions
asked by a developer would be: "What is your FOSS Fair Trade Accreditation level?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;d love to be in a world where that question is asked and, though we&#8217;d need to be
wary of bad actors and have some kind of mechanism for accreditation,
and though it may not solve everything (that would be an unfair standard for any solution), it would certainly be a step forward.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A group of Java engineers gathered in a pub in Prague last night to celebrate many years
of their engagement in NetBeans, all having worked in Sun Microsystems or Oracle or both,
continuing into the Apache world where NetBeans is now found.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will not be the last of such gatherings, anyone involved in NetBeans over
the years is more than welcome to attend or set up similar get togethers,
ideally in a pub, which is also where NetBeans started.</p>

<div class="blogbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href="https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk-dev/2021-May/005616.html" class="bare">https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/jdk-dev/2021-May/005616.html</a></p>

<div class="content">
<pre>"We have updated the JEP with a few changes to the "Issue Warnings"
section [1], summarized as follows:

If the Java runtime is started without setting the system property
'java.security.manager' then a custom Security Manager can be installed
dynamically by calling System::setSecurityManager, just as in Java 16.
No UnsupportedOperationException will be thrown. This call will,
however, issue a warning message explaining that the Security Manager is
deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

We plan to change the default value of the 'java.security.manager'
system property to "disallow" in the next release, i.e., Java 18. That
will cause System::setSecurityManager to throw an
UnsupportedOperationException in Java 18.

With these changes, the process of deprecating and eventually removing
the Security Manager will be consistent with our treatment of past
breaking changes such as, e.g., the strong encapsulation of internal
APIs. Maintainers of libraries and applications will be given fair
warning before any existing code is broken."</pre>

<div class="blogtitle"><a href="../blogs/entry/jep-411-deprecate-the-security1.html">JEP 411: Deprecate the Security Manager for Removal (Part 2)</a></div>
<div class="blogbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Following on from <a href="jep-411-deprecate-the-security.html">part 1 on this topic</a>, <a href="https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/411">JEP 411</a> has recently been updated with a "Future Work" section, amongst other changes.
From the Apache NetBeans perspective, this is a welcome shift in the wording of this JEP.
It is great that the owner and reviewers of JEP 411 recognize the special needs of complex, multi protection domain applications, such as IDEs.
Such applications inherently run "less trusted" code, such as 3rd party JavaBean libraries in design time, and the ability to prevent such libraries to "System::exit" (at least) voluntarily is essential for preventing an IDE from unexpectedly closing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From the Apache NetBeans point of view, however, it is still very concerning to note the sudden incompatible change in SecurityManager behavior and the rapid pace it is proposed to be implemented.
Deprecating SecurityManager now and giving time to the overall Java ecosystem to adapt to such a change is acceptable, however, changing the JVM&#8217;s behavior incompatibly by requiring additional command line switches is disturbing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In particular, no existing version of Apache NetBeans is going to launch with the JEP 411 changes.
Unless one starts the JDK with a special property, it is not going to be possible to use the SecurityManager.
Specifically, <a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-5689">NETBEANS-5689</a> will prevent the IDE from starting.
Should a user provide the proposed "-Djava.security.manager=allow" property, then the launch fails as well due to interaction with the Equinox framework, as shown in link;<a href="https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-5703">NETBEANS-5703</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s face it, there is no known workaround. Apache NetBeans will not launch on JDK 17, i.e., the next LTS of Java.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ideally JEP 411 would actually do what it says and deprecate only, rather than incompatibly changing the JVM&#8217;s behavior.
The Java community should be given the next few years to adjust to the change and release updated versions of libraries (like Equinox) that are ready for the deprecation.
Then applications should be updated (like NetBeans) to use such libraries. Only then should the incompatible mode be turned on, if at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Should the authors of JEP 411 take their shift in understanding the special need of IDEs &amp; other complex multi protection domain applications seriously, they would prevent all sudden incompatibilities related to JEP 411 when deprecating SecurityManager.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="https://mail.openjdk.org/pipermail/security-dev/2021-April/025486.html">JEP 411, announcing the deprecation of java.lang.SecurityManager</a>, one would hope that the use cases for which SecurityManager exists will be replaced by more modern APIs, before it is removed from the OpenJDK. Below is a partial list of use cases for which the SecurityManager is used by Apache NetBeans:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>checkExit.</strong> Ability to prevent accidental invocations of System.exit is very important for any application that deals with other unknown libraries (as IDEs do).
<a href="https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-8199704">JDK-8199704</a> is filled for this, but there is no proposal for an API yet, so it is impossible to tell how the API will cover this use case.
The current API allows, for example, to partially simulate the effect of System.exit, while it also allows to provide a user-understandable message when a real exit is rejected.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Watching file system access.</strong> In various places, both in production code and in tests, SecurityManager is used as a tool to receive notifications of file reading or writing.
This is especially important in integration tests, to guarantee that code is never accessing disk, unless absolutely necessary (for performance reasons, among others).
In principle, the WatchService could be used for these use cases.
However, the WatchService is not guaranteed to work (e.g., due to OS restrictions), it cannot detect read-only access, and requires subscription to individual Paths. SecurityManager provides a more reliable way to monitor all filesystem access done by Java code.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Warning or prevention of use of obsolete and/or dangerous idioms.</strong> The SecurityManager is used to warn about the use of obsolete System properties (via checkPropertyAccess) and the use of`sun.misc.Unsafe unsupported APIs via checkMemberAccess.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Identifying User Application Windows.</strong> The showWindowWithoutWarningBanner permission is used to track which windows belong to which user&#8217;s custom application (so that they can be closed when call to <code>System.exit</code> is intercepted).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Misc.</strong> There are also restrictions on potentially dangerous code, which are probably less important and <a href="https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pipermail/security-dev/2021-April/025495.html">are covered by Reinier&#8217;s e-mail</a>. There are also few (probably) obsoleted workarounds.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_summary">Summary</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Apache NetBeans doesn&#8217;t use java.lang.SecurityManager to guarantee security, but rather to gain additional insight into the JVM&#8217;s behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Without having such insights, the IDE&#8217;s user experience would be severely affected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is to be hoped that replacement APIs are being designed and that they will be provided for evaluation before JEP-411 is integrated.</p>

<p>Researchers at GitHub have identified 26 projects on GitHub that have been infected by malware<a href="#secu">[1]</a>.
The initial point of infection is undetermined and all activity with the malware has been shut down.
The malware relied on project templates generated by Apache NetBeans using an older customized Apache Ant-based build system
that has been in limited use since 2006. This does not impact users of other build systems like Apache Maven or Gradle or even most Apache Ant users.
The majority of Apache NetBeans projects leverage native build tool integrations that are shared with continuous integration systems.
With over 44 million repositories hosted on GitHub<a href="#zdnet">[2]</a>, the scope of these 26 projects looks isolated, these projects have been set to private,
and their owners contacted, while GitHub has not had reason to contact the NetBeans community about this,

<div class="blogtitle"><a href="../blogs/entry/what-to-do-with-javafx.html">What to do with JavaFX and OpenJFX in Apache NetBeans?</a></div>
<div class="blogbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If Apache NetBeans runs on JDK 8, a range of Ant-based JavaFX sample applications are available in NetBeans to help you get started and learn about JavaFX.
However, if NetBeans does not run on JDK 8, the available Ant-based JavaFX samples don&#8217;t work (can&#8217;t be created) but there&#8217;s no point
in working on fixing that since from JDK 11 onwards JavaFX is no longer part of the JDK and Maven/Gradle-based <a href="https://openjfx.io/">OpenJFX samples</a> are obvious
candidates for integration into NetBeans instead.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, how should that be handled in NetBeans? Before Apache NetBeans 11.1,
there was no integration with OpenJFX. Only JavaFX projects and samples were built into NetBeans,
which led to a great deal of confusion since when someone sets up an environment from scratch today,
they&#8217;re unlikely to have installed JDK 8. Much more likely, they&#8217;ll have JDK 11 or 12 and then those JavaFX projects
 and samples in NetBeans cannot be used, i.e., when you try to create those samples, while running NetBeans on anything other than JDK 8,
you&#8217;re simply told in the wizard that you have the wrong JDK. And then you somehow need to find out that the best thing to do next is use
the <a href="https://openjfx.io/openjfx-docs/">OpenJFX documentation</a> to set up the OpenJFX samples in NetBeans.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is suboptimal and so Gluon integrated their two sample applications into Apache NetBeans 11.1, i.e., in the most recent release:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/javafx/openjfx.samples">https://github.com/apache/netbeans/tree/master/javafx/openjfx.samples</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is a step forward but still suboptimal, as explained here by Jaroslav Tulach:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1241#issuecomment-491357016">https://github.com/apache/netbeans/pull/1241#issuecomment-491357016</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That entire new module is not needed. Literally, all that needs to be done is that this file needs to be updated with two new template registrations:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><a href="https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/maven/src/org/netbeans/modules/maven/newproject/MavenWizardIterator.java">https://github.com/apache/netbeans/blob/master/java/maven/src/org/netbeans/modules/maven/newproject/MavenWizardIterator.java</a></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And, literally, this is all that needs to be added there, since the two OpenJFX samples are on Maven Central and as pointed out above, "NetBeans has a nice support for creating wizards over Maven archetypes."</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code data-lang="java">@TemplateRegistration(folder = ArchetypeWizards.TEMPLATE_FOLDER,
position = 925,
displayName = "#LBL_Maven_FXML_Archetype",
iconBase = "org/netbeans/modules/maven/resources/jaricon.png",
description = "javafx.html")
@Messages("LBL_Maven_FXML_Archetype=FXML JavaFX Maven Archetype")
public static WizardDescriptor.InstantiatingIterator&lt;?&gt; openJFXFML() {
    return ArchetypeWizards.definedArchetype("org.openjfx", "javafx-archetype-fxml", "0.0.2", null, LBL_Maven_FXML_Archetype());
}

@TemplateRegistration(folder = ArchetypeWizards.TEMPLATE_FOLDER,
position = 926,
displayName = "#LBL_Maven_Simple_Archetype",
iconBase = "org/netbeans/modules/maven/resources/jaricon.png",
description = "javafx.html")
@Messages("LBL_Maven_Simple_Archetype=Simple JavaFX Maven Archetype")
public static WizardDescriptor.InstantiatingIterator&lt;?&gt; openJFXSimple() {
    return ArchetypeWizards.definedArchetype("org.openjfx", "javafx-archetype-simple", "0.0.2", null, LBL_Maven_Simple_Archetype());
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That literally is all that is needed to be added to the Java source file above, instead of having a completely new module,
which doesn&#8217;t integrate as neatly as the above with the Apache NetBeans infrastructure.
(And this is a small tip for anyone else wanting to make their Maven archetypes available to NetBeans: the above is literally all you need to do.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the fundamental question remains: how do we notify users of Apache NetBeans that they should be using OpenJFX and not JavaFX?
Maybe we should simply remove all JavaFX projects and samples, however that would be unfortunate for anyone using JDK 8.
Or maybe the solution is to create a category named "Legacy" in the New Project dialog and then put all JavaFX projects and samples there,
so that it&#8217;s clear that they&#8217;re not recommended, while still having them available for JDK 8 users?</p>

<p>All references to netbeans.org are replaced with equivalents at netbeans.apache.org and the News column, which pointed to netbeans.org, is removed from the tab below, while the Blogs column is renamed to News, since newsworthy items now come from here, i.e., from this blog:</p>

<p>Also, the Featured Demo on the first tab is removed, best to have as few links to external places as possible, i.e., help reduce potential points of failure, especially here where having that demo in the page doesn&#8217;t add all that much while removing it reduces the need for external URL calls that could cause problems and slow things down.</p>

<div class="blogtitle"><a href="../blogs/entry/why-does-apache-netbeans-need.html">Why Does Apache NetBeans Need Its Own Parsers?</a></div>
<div class="blogbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A question was asked on the <a href="https://lists.apache.org/thread/rdtcvc87pj1d8oj6qcwbm7bjkkr53m5s">Apache NetBeans mailing list</a>: "I was just curious about the theoretical aspect of parsing. Isn&#8217;t there a unified parsing API, using ANTLR/lex/yacc which can parse any language given a grammar for it? Why do we use a different parsing implementation (like the Graal JS parser in this instance) when a unified approach will help us support lots of languages easily?"</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Tim Boudreau, involved in NetBeans from its earliest hours, responds, in the thread linked above:</p>
</div>
<div class="quoteblock">
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, in an IDE, you are <strong>never</strong> just "parsing". You are doing <strong>a lot</strong> with the results of the parse. An IDE doesn&#8217;t have to just parse one file; it must also understand the context of the project that file lives in; how it relates to other files and those files interdependencies; multiple versions of languages; and the fact that the results of a parse do not map cleanly to a bunch of stuff an IDE would show you that would be useful. For example, say the caret is in a java method, and you want to find all other methods that call the one you&#8217;re in and show the user a list of them. The amount of work that has to happen to answer that question is very, very large. To do that quickly enough to be useful, you need to do it ahead of time and have a bunch of indexing and caching software behind the scenes (all of which must be adapted to whatever the parser provides) so you can look it up when you need it. In short, a parser is kind of like a toilet seat by itself. You don&#8217;t want to use it without a whole lot of plumbing attached to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Second, while there are tools like ANTLR (version 4 of which is awesome, by the way), there is still a lot of code you have to write to interact with the results of a parse to do something useful beyond syntax coloring in an IDE. One of my side projects is tooling for NetBeans that <strong>do</strong> let you take an ANTLR grammar and auto generate a lot of the features a language plugin should have. Even with that almost completely declarative, you wind up needing a lot of code. One of the languages I&#8217;m testing it with is a simple language called YASL which lets you define javascript-like schemas with validation constraints (e.g., this field is a string, but it must be at least 7 characters and match this pattern; this is an integer number but it must be &gt; 1 and less than 1000 - that sort of thing). All the parsing goodness in the world won&#8217;t write hints that notice that, say, the maximum is less than the minimum in an integer constraint and offer to swap them. Someone has to write that by hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Third, in an IDE with a 20 year history, a lot of parser generating technologies have come and gone - javacc, javacup, ANTLR, and good old hand-written lexers and parsers. Unifying them all would be an enormous amount of work, would break a lot of code that works just fine, and the end result would be - stuff we&#8217;ve already got, that already works, just with one-parser-generator-to-rule-them-all underneath. Other than prettiness, I don&#8217;t know what problem that solves.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, all of this is to say: We use different parsing implementations because parsing is just a tiny piece of supporting a language, so it wouldn&#8217;t make the hard parts easier enough to be worth it. And there will be new cool parser-generating technologies that come along, and it&#8217;s good to be able to use them, rather than be married to one-parser-generator-to-rule-them-all and have this conversation again, when they come along.</p>

and for the first time, part of a foundation specifically focused on enabling open governance,"
said Geertjan Wielenga, Vice President of Apache NetBeans.
"Every contributor to the project now has equal say over the roadmap and direction of NetBeans. That is a new and historic step and the community has been ready for this for a very long time. Thanks to the strong stewardship of NetBeans in Sun Microsystems and Oracle, Apache NetBeans is now ready for the next phase in its development and we welcome everyone to participate as equals as we move forward."</strong></p>

<p>Disclaimer: Apache NetBeans is an effort undergoing incubation at The Apache
Software Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Apache Incubator.
Incubation is required of all newly accepted projects until a further
review indicates that the infrastructure, communications, and decision
making process have stabilized in a manner consistent with other
successful ASF projects. While incubation status is not necessarily a
reflection of the completeness or stability of the code, it does
indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the ASF.</p>
