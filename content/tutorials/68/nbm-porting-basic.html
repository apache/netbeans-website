<p>This tutorial demonstrates how to port a simple Swing application to the NetBeans Platform. Though the sample is simple, the basic concepts of "porting" an application to the NetBeans Platform will become clear. At the end, some general principles will be identified, based on the steps taken in the tutorial. Hopefully, they will be useful to you when porting your own Swing applications to the NetBeans Platform.</p>

<h2 id="_introduction_to_porting">Introduction to Porting</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before beginning this procedure, it makes sense to ask why one would want to do so in the first place. A typical Swing application consists of a user interface layer on top of a general framework. The general framework normally provides features dealing with an application&#8217;s infrastructure, such as an application&#8217;s menu bar, windowing system (also known as "docking system"), and lifecycle management. Typically this framework is reused by many applications within the same company. The NetBeans Platform exists specifically to cater to these infrastructural concerns. You do not need to create these on your own for your own Swing applications. You can simply move the useful parts of your own application to the NetBeans Platform and then, from that point onwards, the NetBeans Platform will be the new underlying 'plumbing' layer of your application. You can then focus on the more interesting parts of your application, specifically, the user interface. This will speed up your development process and give you a consistent basis for all your applications.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this tutorial, we will begin with the Anagram Game, which is a standard Swing application sample that is distributed with NetBeans IDE. We will, step by step, move it to the NetBeans Platform and then see the advantages and disadvantages of doing so.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_getting_the_anagram_game">Getting the Anagram Game</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We begin by getting the Anagram Game, which is one of the IDE&#8217;s standard Java samples, from the New Project wizard. Then we run it and analyze its parts.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="1">
<li>
<p>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N). Under Categories, select Samples &gt; Java. Under Projects, select Anagram Game. Click Next and Finish.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should now see the Anagram Game application outlined in the Projects window, as shown here:</p>

<p>Before porting this application to the NetBeans Platform, we need to think about <em>the stages in which we want to port our application</em>. In other words, you do not need to port everything at once. And there are different levels to which you can integrate your application, from a mostly superfical level to a level that aligns your application completely with the paradigms and purposes of the NetBeans Platform. The next section will show the levels of compliance your application can have with the NetBeans Platform.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_levels_of_compliance">Levels of Compliance</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Converting an application to be fit for a framework such as the NetBeans Platform can be done on various levels. The integration can be shallow and use just a few integration points or it can be deeper, tightly following the paradigms of the NetBeans Platform.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The stages can be described as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="section-LevelsOfCompliance-Level0Launchable">Level 0: Launchable</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One or more of the following can be done to make your application launchable with as few changes as possible:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Enhance your manifest with NetBeans key/value pairs so that your JAR is recognized as a NetBeans module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use dependencies between modules. With instances of plain Class-Path you can set dependencies between modules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Register a menu item. Simply register a menu item in the declarative layer file ( <code>layer.xml</code> ) of your module, to invoke your original application. This file is created automatically when you create a new module project in NetBeans IDE, as you will see later.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this tutorial, we will do all of the above. We will enhance the manifest, which the module project wizard will do for us. We will create a menu item that will invoke our application. To do so, we will move our application&#8217;s classes into a module source structure. Then we will use the New Action wizard to create a new menu item, which will automatically be registered for us, and a dependency will be set on the Utilities API, which we will need to implement the Action. From that action, we will invoke our application.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="section-LevelsOfCompliance-Level1Integrated">Level 1: Integrated</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here are some pointers for integrating the application more tightly with the NetBeans Platform:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Integrate visually to get the benefits of the NetBeans Window System, which is also known as a docking framework.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use NetBeans Dialog APIs, primarily the  <code>TopComponent</code>  class and the  <code>DialogDisplayer</code>  class.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Change initialization code of your application, use the  <code>ModuleInstall</code>  class or declarative registrations, through the layer file or the META-INF/services folder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this tutorial, we will first create a  <code>JPanel</code>  and move the relevant  <code>JPanel</code>  from the  <code>JFrame</code>  to the new  <code>JPanel</code> . We will use a  <code>DialogDisplayer</code> , from within our action, to call the  <code>JPanel</code> . The  <code>DialogDisplayer</code>  integrates nicely with the NetBeans Platform, unlike a  <code>JFrame</code>  or a  <code>JPanel</code> . For example, the  <code>DialogDisplayer</code>  is modal and it works well with the IDE&#8217;s integrated JavaHelp. Next, we will move the  <code>JPanel</code>  to a  <code>TopComponent</code> . The  <code>TopComponent</code>  class creates a window on the NetBeans Platform, which in our case will show our  <code>JPanel</code> .</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="section-LevelsOfCompliance-Level2UseCaseSupport">Level 2: Use Case Support</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This level of compliance with the NetBeans Platform is concerned with one or more of the following activities:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Bind your application to other modules by inspecting existing functionality and trying to use it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simplify the workflow to fit into the NetBeans Platform paradigms.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Listen to the global selection to discover what other modules are doing and update your state accordingly.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this tutorial, we will listen for the existence of  <code>EditorCookies</code> , using the following statement:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code data-lang="java">EditorCookie ec = activatedNodes[0].getLookup().lookup(EditorCookie.class);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A cookie is a <em>capability</em> and cookies are a powerful feature of NetBeans. With a Java interface, your object&#8217;s capabilities are fixed at compile time, while NetBeans cookies allow your object to behave dynamically because your object can expose capabilities, or not, based on its state. An  <code>EditorCookie</code>  defines an editor, with interfaces for common activities such as opening a document, closing the editor, background loading of files, document saving, and modification notifications. We will listen for the existence of such a cookie and then we will pass the content of the editor to the  <code>TopComponent</code> , in the form of words. By doing this, we are doing what the first item above outlines, i.e., inspecting existing functionality and reusing it within the context of our ported application. This is a modest level of integration. However, it pays off because you are reusing functionality provided by the NetBeans Platform.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="section-LevelsOfCompliance-Level3Aligned">Level 3: Aligned</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this final stage of your porting activity, you are concerned with the following thoughts, first and foremost:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Become a good citizen of the NetBeans Platform, by exposing your own state to other modules so that they know what you are doing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Eliminate duplicated functionality, by reusing the Navigator, Favorites window, Task List, Progress API, etc., instead of creating or maintaining your own.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cooperate with other modules and adapt your application to the NetBeans Platform way of doing things.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Towards the end of this tutorial, we will adopt this level of compliance by letting our  <code>TopComponent</code>  expose a  <code>SaveCookie</code>  when changes are made to the "Guessed Word" text field. By doing this, we will enable the Save menu item under the Tools menu. This kind of integration brings the full benefits of the NetBeans Platform, however it also requires some effort to attain.</p>

<h2 id="_creating_the_module_project_source_structure">Creating the Module Project Source Structure</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let&#8217;s create the source structure of our module. We use a wizard to do so. This is the typical first step of creating a new module for a NetBeans Platform application.</p>

</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also make sure to fill in the XML Layer field, which specifies the location and name of the module&#8217;s configuration file. By default, the field is empty because not all NetBeans modules need a configuration file. In this case, you will need one, so fill out the field as shown below:</p>

<p>In return, the lifecycle of the original application is now handled by the NetBeans Platform and you can leverage as much of the existing modules' functionality as is reasonable for your module.

<h2 id="_next_steps">Next Steps</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several next steps one can take at this point, aside from further aligning the module with the NetBeans Platform, as outlined above:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Become aware of the differences between standard Swing applications and the NetBeans Platform.</strong> For the most part, the standard Swing approach to creating a user interface will continue to work for your NetBeans Platform application. However, the NetBeans Platform approach is better, easier, or both in some cases. One example is that of the NetBeans Dialogs API. The standard Swing approach, via, for example, the  <code>JOptionsPane</code> , works OK, but using the NetBeans Dialogs API is easier, because it automatically centers your dialog in the application and allows you to dismiss it with the ESC key. Using the Dialogs API also lets you plug in a different DialogDisplayer, which can make it easier to customize or test your application.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Below is a list of the principle differences between the typical Swing approach and that of the NetBeans Platform:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Loading of images</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loading of resource bundles and localized string</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assigning of mnemonics to labels and buttons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Showing dialogs</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For details on all of the above items, read this FAQ:  <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/wiki/devfaqnbideosyncracies">Common calls that should be done slightly differently in NetBeans than standard Swing apps (loading images, localized strings, showing dialogs)</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, note that, since the NetBeans Platform now handles the lifecycle of your module, since it is now part of the whole application, you can no longer use  <code>System.exit</code> . Instead, you need to use  <code>LifecycleManager</code> . To run code on start up, which should only be done when absolutely necessary, you need to use the NetBeans  <code>ModuleInstall</code>  class and, specifically, its  <code>restored</code>  method. A useful reference in this context is  <a href="http://www.ociweb.com/jnb/jnbOct2005.html#porting">Porting a Java Swing Application to the NetBeans Platform</a>, by Tom Wheeler, in  <a href="http://www.ociweb.com/jnb/jnbOct2005.html#porting">Building A Complete NetBeans Platform Application</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Create a module project for each distinct part of your application.</strong> The NetBeans Platform provides a modular architecture out of the box. Break your application into one or more modules. Doing so requires some analysis of your original application and an assessment of which parts could best fit within a new module and how to communicate between them. Since the example in this tutorial was simple, we only needed one module. A next step might be to put the  <code>WordLibrary</code>  class in a separate module and expose it as a public API. Doing so would let other modules provide user interfaces on top of the API provided by the first module, as shown here:</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/porting_agf9.png" alt="porting agf9">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As shown above, you need to put the modules in a module suite. Then set a dependency in the plugin module on the API module, using the Libraries panel in the plugin module&#8217;s Project Properties dialog box. The size of each module, i.e., when one should create a new module or continue developing within an existing one, is a question of debate. Smaller is better, in general.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Always keep reevaluating what you really need to port.</strong> Look at the NetBeans Platform and decide where there is overlap with your own application. Where there is overlap, such as the menu bar and About box, decide what you want to do. Typically, you want to leverage as much as possible from the NetBeans Platform. Therefore, you would port as little as possible from your own application, while keeping as much of it as is useful to you.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Move distinct parts of your user interface to one or more TopComponents.</strong> On the NetBeans Platform, the  <code>TopComponent</code>  class provides the top level Swing container. In effect, it is a window. Move the user interface from your original application to one or more of these windows and discard your original  <code>JFrame</code> s.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Copy the Java classes that do not provide user interface elements.</strong> We simply copied the original  <code>WordLibrary.java</code>  class. You can do the same with the model of your own Swing applications. You might need to tweak some code to smoothen the transition between the old Swing application and the new NetBeans Platform application, but (as in the case shown in this tutorial) this might not even be necessary.</p>
