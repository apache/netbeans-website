<p>This tutorial provides a very simple and quick introduction to the NetBeans Platform workflow by walking you through the creation of a simple HTML Editor. Though simple to create, the HTML Editor you create will be a mature application because it will reuse the infrastructure provided by the NetBeans Platform, as well as several modules from NetBeans IDE. For example, without any coding, your HTML Editor will have a mature window system, which it reuses from the NetBeans Platform. Once you are done with this tutorial, you will have a general understanding of how to create, build, and run applications on top of the NetBeans Platform.</p>

<p>After you finish this tutorial, you can move on to the  <a href="https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/platform.html">NetBeans Platform learning trail</a>. The learning trail provides comprehensive tutorials that highlight a wide range of NetBeans APIs for a variety of application types. If you do not want to do a "Hello World" application, you can skip this tutorial and jump straight to the learning trail.</p>

This document uses NetBeans IDE 7.2 and NetBeans Platform 7.2. If you are using an earlier version of these products, see  <a href="71/nbm-htmleditor.html">the previous version of this document</a>. If this is your first encounter with the NetBeans Platform, you are recommended to work through the  <a href="nbm-quick-start.html">NetBeans Platform Quick Start</a> before continuing with this one.

<p>The HTML Editor that you create in this tutorial is a rich-client application built "on top of the NetBeans Platform". What this means is that the core of the IDE, which is what the NetBeans Platform <em>is</em>, will be the base of your application. On top of the NetBeans Platform, you add the modules that you need and exclude the ones that the IDE needs but that your application doesn&#8217;t. Here you see some of the IDE&#8217;s modules, added to the NetBeans Platform, which is its base:</p>

<p>Creating this HTML Editor means generating an application skeleton, excluding the modules and user interface items that you do not need, and then setting the NetBeans IDE&#8217;s Favorites window as the window that will open by default when the IDE starts. The Favorites window will be rebranded so that it will be a browser for HTML documents. All of these activities are supported by user interface elements in the IDE, as you will learn in this tutorial.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will see for yourself how simple and easy it is to build, or to be more precise, to <em>assemble</em> a full-featured application on top of the NetBeans Platform. At the end, you are shown how to make the final product easily downloadable and launchable using WebStart.</p>

Even though it is a separate product, there is no need to download the NetBeans Platform separately for purposes of this tutorial. You will develop the rich-client application in the IDE and then exclude the modules that are specific to the IDE but that are superfluous to you application.

<p>When creating an application on the NetBeans Platform, the very first step is to create a NetBeans Platform Application project. The template we will use to create our new NetBeans Platform Application project includes a subset of the modules provided by the NetBeans Platform.</p>

<div class="olist arabic">

<p>In the Basic panel, make sure that you like the application title for the titlebar, as well as the icons, as shown below:</p>

Now that the application has been branded, let&#8217;s make sure that the modules we need for our HTML editor are available to the application. Right-click the project node, choose Properties, and then go to the Libraries panel in the Project Properties dialog box. Here you see a list of "clusters". A cluster is a collection of related modules and represents a folder in your installation directory. The only clusters that need to be selected are, in the first place,  <code>platform</code> , which is already selected, but expand it and <em>also</em> select "favorites", which provides the Favorites window that you will use to open HTML files later. Next, expand the  <code>ide</code>  cluster, and select all the HTML modules in the "ide" cluster, as shown below:</p>

<h2 id="_distributing_the_application">Distributing the Application</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Choose one of two approaches for distributing your application. If you want to maintain as much control over your application as possible, you will use web start (JNLP) to distribute your application over the web. In this scenario, whenever you want to update the application, you will do so locally and let your end users know about the update, which they will automatically have available next time they start up your application over the web. Alternatively, distribute a ZIP file containing your application. The end users will then have the complete application locally available. You would then distribute updates and new features via the update mechanism, described below.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_distributing_the_application_via_a_zip_file">Distributing the Application via a ZIP File</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To make your application extendable, you need to let your users install modules to enhance the application&#8217;s functionality. To do so, your application is already bundling the Plugin Manager.</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="1">
<li>
<p>Choose the Tools | Plugins menu item and install some plugins that are useful to your HTML Editor. Browse the  <a href="http://plugins.netbeans.org/PluginPortal/">Plugin Portal</a> to find some suitable ones. This is also how your end users will update their local installation of your application.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic" start="2">
<li>
<p>Right-click the application&#8217;s project node and choose Build ZIP Distribution.</p>

In the  <code>dist</code>  folder (visible in the Files window), you should now be able to see a ZIP file, as follows:</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_distributing_the_html_editor_via_the_shared_netbeans_web_start_repository">Distributing the HTML Editor via the Shared NetBeans Web Start Repository</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of distributing a ZIP file, let&#8217;s prepare for a webstart distribution by finetuning the  <code>master.jnlp</code>  file that is generated the first time you start the application via "Run JNLP Application". Even though it does the job, it is not yet ready for distribution. At the very least, you need to change the information section to provide better descriptions and icons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another change to the standard JNLP infrastructure is the use of a shared JNLP repository on www.netbeans.org. By default, the JNLP application generated for a suite always contains all its modules as well as all the modules it depends on. This may be useful for intranet usage, but it is a bit less practical for wide internet use. When on the internet, it is much better if all the applications built on the NetBeans Platform refer to one repository of NetBeans modules, which means that such modules are shared and do not need to be downloaded more than once.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is such a repository for NetBeans Platform. It does not contain all the modules that NetBeans IDE has, but it contains enough to make most of non-IDE applications like our HTML Editor possible. To use the repository, you only need to modify the application&#8217;s  <code>platform.properties</code>  by adding the correct URL:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"># share the libraries from common repository on netbeans.org
# this URL is for release72 JNLP files:
jnlp.platform.codebase=http://bits.netbeans.org/7.2/jnlp/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, for 7.1:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"># share the libraries from common repository on netbeans.org
# this URL is for release71 JNLP files:

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, for 7.0:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="prettyprint highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java"># share the libraries from common repository on netbeans.org
# this URL is for release70 JNLP files:
jnlp.platform.codebase=http://bits.netbeans.org/7.0/jnlp/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Similarly, for 6.9:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As soon as the application is started as a JNLP application, all its shared plug-in modules are going to be loaded from netbeans.org and shared with other applications doing the same.</p>
