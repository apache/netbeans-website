<p>
  The Editor Braces Matching module provides the
  <a href="http://netbeans.apache.org/javadoc/dev/org-netbeans-modules-editor-bracesmatching/overview-summary.html">BracesMatchingSPI</a>
  for registering services capable of finding matching
  areas of text in a document. These areas can be pretty much anything and the rules
  for finding them are solely up to the implementors. A typical usecase and the main
  motivation for this SPI is to be able to implement language specific matchers
  for finding pairs of braces, highlighting them and allowing users to move a caret
  (navigate) from one to the other. The matching areas can also be for example
  XML, HTML or JSP tags.
  </p>

  
<p>
  The Braces Matching SPI is a replacement for the old SPI in
  <code>org.netbeans.editor.ExtSyntaxSupport</code>.
  </p>
  
  
<h3>The infrastructure overview</h3>
  
  
<p>
  The following paragraphs give an overview of the infrastructure used for braces
  matching and explain the essential terminology and ideas behind it.
  </p>
  
  
<h4>Original and matching areas</h4>
  
  
<p>
  The whole task of finding matching areas can be split in two parts. First we need
  to determine if the caret is positioned over a character or an area that could
  possibly have another matching areas. And if so, then we need to find those areas.
  For the purpose of this SPI we call the area at the caret the <b>original area</b>
  and the other areas are simply the <b>matching areas</b>.
  </p>
  
  
<pre xml:space="preserve">
    for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) <span style="background-color : #C0FFC0;">{</span>
        System.out.println(i);
    <span style="background-color : #FFC0C0;">}</span>|

    | - the caret
    <span style="background-color : #FFC0C0;">&nbsp;</span> - original area
    <span style="background-color : #C0FFC0;">&nbsp;</span> - matching area
  </pre>

  
<p>
  There is always only one original area, if there is any at all. On the other hand
  the matchers are free to report as many matching areas as they like. In most
  cases, however, the matchers will only report none or one matching are as well.
  </p>
  
  
<h4>Caret Bias</h4>
  
  
<p>
  Normally when typing or moving a caret in the editor one of the characters is
  always considered to lay 'under' a caret. The decision if it is the character
  on the left hand side or right hand side of a caret depends on the shape of
  the caret. Although the visual appearance of a caret can vary, there are generaly
  only two shapes to consider. The I-beam caret and the block caret.
  </p>

  
<p>
  The I-beam caret normally looks like a vertical line placed on a position
  between characters in text. However, when typing it is generally accepted that
  the left hand side character is the one under the I-beam caret. The I-beam caret
  is used in Netbeans editor when editing text in the normal mode.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  The block caret on the other hand may look like a little square or vertical line
  placed beneath or under a character. This type of caret makes it visually very clear
  what character is 'under' the caret. It is the right hand side character. In
  Netbeans editor the block caret is used for the overwrite mode.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  When searching for the original area the search has always to start at the
  character 'under' a caret - the <b>important character</b>. In order not
  to tie the braces matching infrastructure to a praticular implementation of
  a caret we use the parameter <b>caret bias</b> to describe on which side of
  a caret the important character lies. Obviously the caret bias can only have
  two values - <b>backward</b> or <b>forward</b> - designating positions on the
  left or right hand side of the caret.
  </p>

  
<p>
  Because the search for the original area always starts with the important character
  the result of this search is directly influenced by the caret bias. 
  The search could result in two different original areas depending on the value
  of the caret bias, even if the actual position of the caret was not changed.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  The caret bias is not only used for searching for the original area, but it is also
  used when navigating (jumping) between matching areas. The navigation is always done
  in a way to make the matching area where we are navigating to to appear on the
  same side of the caret as is the side of the caret bias. This makes sure that
  the matching area will be recognized as the next original area. (Strictly speaking
  this also depends on the particular matcher implementation that was used for
  finding the areas.)
  </p>
  
  
<h4>Search direction</h4>
  
  
<p>
  In general when looking for the original area we not only want to look right
  next to a caret, but we also want to search <i>a little bit further</i>. Looking
  a little bit further makes it easier for users to see the matching areas and
  navigate between them. They don't have to position the caret right at a brace
  in order to see the matching one or navigate to it.
  The scope of this search should, however, never leave the line with the caret
  and in some situations it might be restricted even more.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  Although there are only two directions to look in - <b>backward</b> or <b>forward</b> -
  in a real situation looking in both directions gives more practical results.
  That is why the infrastructure supports the following two search directions.
  </p>
  
  
<ul>
  
<li>
<b>Backward preferred</b> - for searching in the backward direction first
  and if no original area can be found then searching in the forward direction.
  </li>
  
<li>
<b>Forward preferred</b> - for searching in the forward direction first
  and if no original area can be found then searching in the backward direction.
  </li>
  
</ul>
  
  
<h4>Maximum lookahead</h4>
  
  
<p>
  The maximum distance, measured in characters from the position of a caret, that
  the search should be attempted in is called maximum lookahead. The infrastructure
  uses independent values for both search directions and calls them
  <b>maximum backward lookahead</b> and <b>maximum forward lookahead</b>.
  The lookahead
  is normally limited by the beginning and end of a line with the caret, but
  can be further limited by those two parameters. The absolute lookahead maximum
  in each direction enforced by the infrastructure is 256 characters
  </p>

  
<p>
  There is an important relationship between maximum lookaheads and the caret bias. The
  maximum lookaheads can <b>never</b> obscure the important character. In other words
  the maximum lookahead in the direction of the caret bias will not prevent the infrastructure
  from searching through the important character (ie. the character right next to the caret).
  </p>
  
  
<h4>
<a name="controlling-parameters" shape="rect">Controlling the parameters</a>
</h4>
  
  
<p>
  There is no API for controlling caret bias, search direction and maximum lookaheads
  on the global level. It is expected that the module implementing the braces matching
  infrastructure will expose its own GUI for user to control those parameters. This
  GUI is yet to be designed. By default the infrastructure will set the parameters
  to mimic the behavior of the existing (old) implementation of braces matching
  done using <code>org.netbeans.editor.ExtSyntaxSupport</code>.
  </p>

  
<p>
  On the other hand the parameters can be controlled on per-component basis by
  setting appropriate client properties. This is to allow interested modules
  such as the jVi plugin to overwrite global settings and implement their own
  searching policies. The following properties are supported.
  </p>
  
  
<ul>
  
<li>
<code>nbeditor-bracesMatching-caretBias</code> - The caret bias to determine
  the important character, available
  values are <code>backward</code> and <code>forward</code>.
  </li>
  
<li>
<code>nbeditor-bracesMatching-searchDirection</code> - The direction to
  search in for the original area. Available values are <code>backward-preferred</code>
  and <code>forward-preferred</code>.
  </li>
  
<li>
<code>nbeditor-bracesMatching-maxBackwardLookahead</code> - The maximum
  distance to search in when searching backward. The allowed values are <code>0</code>
  - <code>256</code>.
  </li>
  
<li>
<code>nbeditor-bracesMatching-maxForwardLookahead</code> - The maximum
  distance to search in when searching forward. The allowed values are <code>0</code>
  - <code>256</code>.
  </li>
  
</ul>
  
  
  
<h3>Key parts of the SPI</h3>
  
  
<p>Modules implementing the SPI are shielded from most of the complexity of
  the braces matching infrastructure as it was described earlier. Thier job is
  as simple as being able to search in one direction through the requested number
  of characters. The SPI provides all the neccessary information to perform
  such search as well as mechanisms for registering implemented matchers.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  The main part of the SPI is the
  <code><a href="http://netbeans.apache.org/javadoc/dev/org-netbeans-modules-editor-bracesmatching/org/netbeans/spi/editor/bracesmatching/BracesMatcher.html" shape="rect">BracesMatcher</a></code>
  interface, which
  needs to be implemented by anybody who wishes to provide a text matching
  services for a particular type of documents. Implementations of the
  <code>BracesMatcher</code> interface can be plugged in to the system by
  registering 
  <code><a href="http://netbeans.apache.org/javadoc/dev/org-netbeans-modules-editor-bracesmatching/org/netbeans/spi/editor/bracesmatching/BracesMatcherFactory.html" shape="rect">BracesMatcherFactory</a></code> 
  in the MIME lookup.
  </p>
  
  
<p>The braces matching
  infrastructure will use registered factories to create matchers for highlighting
  matching areas in documents. Each type of a document (ie. mime type or more
  precisely each mime path) can have at most one <code>BracesMatcher</code> registered.
  If there is more different implementations registered for the same mime path
  the infrastructure will only use the first one.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  When asking a <code>BracesMatcherFactory</code> to create an instance of
  <code>BracesMatcher</code> the infrastructure passes the factory an instance of
  <code><a href="http://netbeans.apache.org/javadoc/dev/org-netbeans-modules-editor-bracesmatching/org/netbeans/spi/editor/bracesmatching/MatcherContext.html" shape="rect">MatcherContext</a></code>, 
  which provides information about a document
  and a position in that document, where the search should start.
  </p>

  
  
<h3>BracesMatcher registration</h3>
  
  
<p>
  The registration of <code>BracesMatcher</code>s has to be done through an
  instance of the <code>BracesMatcherFactory</code> class. The factory should
  be registered in <code>MimeLookup</code> under the mime-type of documents, which
  the <code>BracesMatcher</code> should be used for. For example, if a module
  wants to provide <code>BracesMatcher</code> for <code>text/x-something</code> documents
  it should implement its own <code>BracesMatcherFactory</code> (e.g.
  <code>org.some.module.BMFactory</code> class) and register it in <code>MimeLookup</code>
  using its XML layer as it is shown on the example below.
  </p>
  
  
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&lt;folder name="Editors"&gt;
  &lt;folder name="text"&gt;
    &lt;folder name="x-something"&gt;
        &lt;folder name="BracesMatchers"&gt;
            &lt;file name="org-some-module-BMFactory.instance" /&gt;
        &lt;/folder&gt;
    &lt;/folder&gt;
  &lt;/folder&gt;
&lt;/folder&gt;
  </pre>

  
<p>
  The <code>BMFactory</code> class will simply return a new instance of
  the module's implementation of the <code>BracesMatcher</code> interface from its
  <code>createMatcher</code>
  method.
  </p>

  
  
<h3>Languages embedding</h3>
  
  
<p>
  The registration mechanism described earlier and the general concept of MIME lookup
  allows to provide special <code>BracesMatcher</code>s for embedded languages.
  The braces matching infrastructure will always try to find the inner-most language at
  a position in a document, where the search should start. It will then create
  the <code>BracesMatcher</code> according to the mime path of that inner-most
  language.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  As per the general inheritance rules defined by MIME lookup this may result
  in using a <code>BracesMatcher</code> that is registered for a top level
  language (ie. mime type) different from the main language of the scanned
  document. Here is an example of a java snippet in a JSP page, the caret's
  position is indicated by the '|' pipe character. Assuming that there are only
  two <code>BracesMatcher</code> implementations registered - one for <code>text/x-jsp</code>
  and the other one for <code>text/x-java</code>, the infrastructure's attempt to find a matcher
  for the <code>text/x-jsp/text/x-java</code> mime path is going to result in
  finding the matcher registered for <code>text/x-java</code>.
  </p>
  
  
<pre xml:space="preserve">
&lt;% for(int i = 0; i &lt; 10; i++) <span style="background-color : pink;">{</span> %&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;%=i%&gt;. column&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;% <span style="background-color : pink;">}</span>| %&gt;;
  </pre>
  
  
<p>
  Since the support for languages embedding comes with the new Lexer API, the
  above example is naturally only going to work for document types that provide
  a <code>Lexer</code> implementation. This is the case for the most document types
  supported in Netbeans 6. In case that a document does not have a <code>Lexer</code>
  the infrastructure will fall back to using the document's main mime type ignoring
  any other languages that may potentially be embedded in the document.
  </p>
  
  
<h3>Threading</h3>

  
<p>
  While finding the original brace is relatively simle task, because it's always
  done in a limited and quite small area around a caret, finding the matching
  brace can take much more time and in generall it can involve searching through
  a whole document. The search is normally done in response to a moving caret,
  which means that there can be a lot of search requests generated
  when a user moves the caret quickly over some text. It is not very important
  to show all the results as the caret moves, but it is important to show the
  last result when the caret stops moving.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  In order not to impact responsiveness of the editor and its caret the braces matching
  infrastructure performs all searches in a background thread outside of the Swing's
  event thread. If needed a running task is cancelled and rescheduled with new
  parameters reflecting the latest position of the caret. The <code>BracesMatcher</code>s
  implemented by modules are <b>required</b> to react accordingly when a search task
  is cancelled. This is described in detail in the javadoc for <code>BracesMatcher</code>.
  </p>

  
  
<h3>Constraints and limitations</h3>
  
  
<p>
  The current design does not cover searching for areas in right-to-left documents. This
  usecase has not been even analyzed and may prove itself unsolvable withough major changes
  in the infrastructure and the SPI.
  </p>

                    The concept of using <code>Thread.currentThread().interrupt()</code>
                    for canceling braces matching tasks is flawed. The call breaks
                    synchronization of other parts ofthe system that are used from the
                    braces matching tasks, which results in <code>InterruptedException</code>s

<h3>Use Cases</h3>
<answer id="arch-usecases">
  
<p>
  Although the SPI can generally by used for highlighting areas in a document
  that have something in common, the usecases below are demonstrated on a simple
  braces matching example. This example is used for its simplicity and clarity,
  but it could be substituted by more complex examples.
  </p>

  
<p>
  The usecases listed here were heavily inspired by comments in issues
  <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=95126" shape="rect">95126</a> and
  <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=66037" shape="rect">66037</a>.
  </p>
  
  
<h5>Usecase 1. - Highlighting results</h5>
  
<p>
  Probably the main reason why this SPI exists is to allow Netbeans editor to
  highlight matching braces in a document. The highlighting itself is done by the
  infrastructure and is not of a concern for <code>BracesMatcher</code> implementors.
  It should be possible to highlight independently
  (ie. in a different color) both the original brace and the matching brace. It should also
  be possible to highlight the original brace in a special color when its matching
  brace can't be found. The colors obviously have to be customizable by users.
  </p>
  
  
  
<h5>Usecase 2. - Navigating between results</h5>
  
<p>
  If the original brace is detected and its matching brace is found Netbeans editor
  needs to allow an easy navigation between those two positions (ie. jumping
  from the original brace to the matching one and back).
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  In general if there is more than one matching area users should be allowed to cycle
  through all of them. Since there is only one editor action (shortcut) for navigating
  between matching areas the cycling is only done in one direction (backward). In
  order for cycling to work properly the <code>BracesMatcher</code> implementation has to report
  matching areas in a consistent way. That is the matching areas should always be
  sorted by their position in a document, starting with the one at the lowest offset.
  </p>
  

  
<h5>Usecase 3. - Different search scenarios</h5>
  
<p>
  The users are likely to have different preferences for the way how braces matching
  works therefore its behavior should be customizable. We have listed below several
  possible scenarios that can be used simply by setting different values for the
  search parameters described before. They all differ in the way how the original
  area is detected.
  </p>

  
<p>
  The shortcuts for the parameters have the following meaning - <code>MBL</code>
  ... max backward lookahead, <code>MFL</code> ... max forward lookahead,
  <code>SD</code> ... search direction, <code>CB</code> ... caret bias. The values
  are <code>B</code> ... backward or backward preferred and 
  <code>F</code> ... forward or forward preferred. The question mark <code>?</code>
  means that the value of this parameter has no effect for the search.

<a name="search-scenario-A" shape="rect"><code>MBL = 0, MFL = 0, SD = ?, CB = F</code></a> : Check only the right hand side
      character of the caret. This is the default for Netbeans overwrite mode (ie. the
      block shaped caret).
  </li>
  
<li>
      
<a name="search-scenario-B" shape="rect"><code>MBL = 1, MFL = 1, SD = ?, CB = B</code></a> : Check characters right next to
      the caret on both its sides. This is the default for Netbeans normal mode (ie.
      the I-beam shaped caret).
  </li>
  
<li>
      
<code>MBL = 0, MFL = 256, SD = F, CB = B</code> : Check the character on the
      left hand side of the caret, otherwise search forward. This is the default
      for jVi insert mode.
  </li>
  
<li>
      
<code>MBL = 0, MFL = 256, SD = F, CB = F</code> : Search forward from the caret.
      This is the default for jVi command mode.

<li>
      
<code>MBL = 256, MFL = 256, SD = F, CB = B</code> : Check the left hand side
      character, otherwise search forward first and then backward. Suitable for
      I-beam carets that detect the original area anywhere on the line with the
      caret giving preferrence to the area positioned forward from the caret. The
      preferrence for the backward positioned area can simply be achieved by changing
      the search direction (ie. <code>SD = B</code>).
  </li>
  
<li>
      
<code>MBL = 256, MFL = 256, SD = F, CB = F</code> : The same as
      option E, but for the block carets.
  </li>
  
</ul>
  
  
  
<h5>Usecase 4. - Auto-switching the search scenario</h5>
  
<p>
  The editor in Netbeans can operate in two modes - normal and overwrite. They both
  use different shape of a caret and thus need a different caret bias. The braces
  matching infrastructure should detect what mode the editor is in and change the
  parameters used for searching for the original area accordingly. The caret bias
  is the most important parameter, but other parameters may need to be changed too.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  This feature should of course be only active for text components where the parameters
  have not been overwritten by some other module.
  </p>
  
  
<p>
  By default the two search scenarios used for the normal and overwrite modes in
  Netbeans editor are the <a href="#search-scenario-B" shape="rect">scenario B</a> for the normal
  mode and <a href="#search-scenario-A" shape="rect">scenario A</a> for the overwrite mode. In
  general scenarios from both editor modes should be customizable by users.
