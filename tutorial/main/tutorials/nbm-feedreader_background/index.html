<h2 id="a15328"><a class="anchor" href="#a15328"></a>About Frequently Used Terms</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tutorial assumes that you have a basic conceptual understanding of the infrastructure that is built right into NetBeans. There is less to understand than you might think. Common terms to be familiar with are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>* NetBeans Platform.* The application framework that provides everything most desktop applications need and nothing superfluous. The NetBeans Platform provides an application&#8217;s common requirements, such as standard menus, toolbars, document management, and settings, right out-of-the-box. Building an application "on top of NetBeans" means that, instead of writing applications from scratch, you only provide the parts of your application that the NetBeans Platform does not already have. And you exclude the parts of the NetBeans Platform that you do not need. At the end of the development cycle, you bundle your application with the NetBeans Platform, but with your own executable and splash screen. Doing so saves you a lot of time and energy and results in a solid, reliable application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>* System Filesystem.* The general registry that contains NetBeans configuration information, built from the  <code> layer.xml</code>  configuration files of the registered modules. NetBeans stores a wide variety of configuration information in the System Filesystem. For example, the System Filesystem contains a folder called  <code> Menu</code>  , which contains subfolders with names such as  <code> File</code>  and  <code> Edit</code>  . These subfolders contain files that represent Java classes which implement the actions that appear in the "File" and "Edit" menus in the IDE.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>* Module.* A group of Java classes that provides an application with a specific feature. For example, the feature provided by the Java classes in the plug-in module that you build in this tutorial is an RSS/Atom feed reader. The Java classes use the  <code> manifest.mf</code>  file to declare the module and the  <code> layer.xml</code>  configuration file to register their functionality in the System Filesystem.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an aside: in NetBeans terminology, "plug-in" is an adjective while "module" is a noun. There is no semantic difference between them.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>* NetBeans APIs.* The public interfaces and classes which are available to module writers and application writers. They are divided into specific APIs for dealing with different types of functionality. The contents and behavior of the Java source packages and their subpackages, as specified in the API reference documentation, are the APIs. For the full NetBeans API List, click  <a href="https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/">here</a> .</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>* Module Suite.* A group of interdependent modules that are deployed together. The IDE helps you to brand the suite&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;for example, you can add a splash screen and you can specify the parts of the NetBeans Platform that you don&#8217;t want your application to provide.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="a95124"><a class="anchor" href="#a95124"></a>About the Feed Reader Application</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While writing the Feed Reader Application, you will leverage a lot of the NetBeans infrastructure. The first piece you leverage is the System Filesystem. As pointed out earlier, the System Filesystem consists of configuration data: it is built from the configuration files (each of which is stored on disk as  <code> layer.xml</code>  files) of all the modules in the system, which it writes into the user&#8217;s settings directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The System Filesystem uses the same infrastructure for recognizing files that is used for recognizing a user&#8217;s files on disk. That means you can show a view of a folder inside the configuration data of the IDE just as easily as you can show a folder on disk. This way you can use all of the plumbing that is built into NetBeans for viewing files and showing trees and so forth. In fact, many views you see in the IDE use the same technique. For example, the Favorites window is a view of a folder in the System Filesystem, which contains links to files on disk. The contents of the Runtime window are also a view of a folder in the System Filesystem, which is why plug-in modules are able to add nodes to it. Since it uses the same mechanisms as are used for recognizing files on disk, the objects inside a folder can have whatever icons and display names you choose to give them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other piece you use is the  <a href="https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/overview-summary.html">Nodes API</a> . The Nodes API is a generalization of TreeNode, though Nodes can be displayed in a variety of viewer components, not just trees. Nodes typically represent DataObjects. A DataObject is basically a parsed file, in other words, a Java object that knows the meaning of what is in a file or what the file represents and can do something with it. Nodes add features to DataObjects that the user interacts with, such as actions, localized display names, and icons.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, after using wizards to generate some basic templates, you will use the  <code> layer.xml</code>  file to create a folder in the System Filesystem for RSS feed objects ( <a href="#34280">Creating the RssFeeds Folder</a> ). Next, you will provide a view of the folder, similar to the IDE&#8217;s Projects window or Files window, by building on top of one of the generated files ( <a href="#22179">Extending the Feed Window</a> ). The view is rooted in your folder for RSS feed objects. Then you get the DataObject representing that folder, and its Node. You will wrap that node in a FilterNode ( <a href="#34280">Creating the RssFeeds Folder</a> ). A FilterNode is a node that can act as a wrapper for another node; by default it behaves exactly as the other node does, but you can override methods on it to change things, so that you can give it your own icon, display name and actions. Then you wrap each of the node&#8217;s children as well, doing the same thing for them as for the node.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you will create an Add Feed action on the root node. When the user adds an RSS feed, you do something very simple: you create a new Feed object (really just an object that contains the URL, <a href="#62391">Creating the Feed Object</a> ) and then serialize that Feed object as a file in your RSSFeeds folder. Since you&#8217;re using NetBeans built-in infrastructure for visualizing files (because you&#8217;re just getting the standard node for the folder, which can notice when files are added or removed), in a split second the node for the newly added feed will appear in the user interface. Using the System Filesystem this way means that the amount of code you have to write to save the list of RSS feeds on exit is&#8230;&#8203; none at all! You save a feed when the user creates it, and that data is persisted to disk automatically. So, basically, you are just dropping Feed POJOs into a folder, and you happen to be showing a view of that folder. The system takes care of virtually everything else.</p>

<p>The FeedReader sample consists of main files (Java classes) and supporting files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Main files:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code> Feed.java</code>  Encapsulates a URL and its associated Rome feed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code> FeedAction.java</code>  Defines the action that appears in the Window menu with the label Open Feed Window. It opens the Feed Window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code> FeedTopComponent.java</code>  Defines the action that appears in the Window menu with the label Open Feed Window. It opens the Feed Window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code> RssNode.java</code>  Node class for the RSS feeds folder and its children. Note that mainly you proxy the actual DataNode/DataFolder for the RssFeeds folder in the System Filesystem. This gives you a lot of functionality for free, like the ability to delete, listening for changes, etc. So when you add a new RSS feed, all you do is create a new Feed object and serialize it into that folder.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Supporting files:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code> build.xml</code>  Provides Ant targets for common tasks, such as building and running the application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code> Bundle.properties</code>  Localization key-value pairs.</p>

</li>
<li>
<p><code> project.xml</code>  Declares project metadata, such as module dependencies. You will be shown how to use the Project Properties dialog box to work with this file.</p>
</li>
<li>
