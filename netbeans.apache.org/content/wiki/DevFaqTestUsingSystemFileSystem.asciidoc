=== How do I test something which uses the System Filesystem?

There is a fake System FileSystem provided by as soon as FileSystem link:API.asciidoc[API] is on classpath. It understands link:NetBeans.asciidoc[NetBeans] layer definitions and is generally suitable for running unit tests.

In case you see difference from expected behavior:

* Try to run tests in link:DevFaqUsingSimpletests.asciidoc[real mode]
* Report link:NetBeans.asciidoc[NetBeans] a bug (product platform/filesystems) with a test case
