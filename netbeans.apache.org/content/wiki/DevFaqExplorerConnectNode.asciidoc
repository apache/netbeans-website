=== How do I show a Node to my Explorer View?

Once you have a component to show link:DevFaqWhatIsANode.asciidoc[Nodes ], you will need to set the _root node_ whose children it will display (some views show the root node, some don't, in some cases you can set whether it does or not).

Presumably you have an link:DevFaqExplorerManager.asciidoc[ExplorerManager ] set up for your view - just get that and call `setRootContext (someNode)` and the view will display it.
