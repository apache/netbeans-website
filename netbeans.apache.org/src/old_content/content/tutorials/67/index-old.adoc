== What is the NetBeans Platform?

The NetBeans Platform is a broad Swing-based framework on which you can base large desktop applications. The IDE itself is based on the NetBeans Platform. The Platform contains APIs that simplify the handling of windows, actions, files, and many other things typical in applications.

Each distinct feature in a NetBeans Platform application can be provided by a distinct NetBeans module, which is comparable to a plugin. A NetBeans module is a group of Java classes that provides an application with a specific feature.

You can also create new modules for NetBeans IDE itself. For example, you can write modules that make your favorite cutting-edge technologies available to users of NetBeans IDE. Alternatively, you might create a module to provide an additional editor feature.
