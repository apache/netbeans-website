:description: NetBeans Platform CRUD Application Tutorial - Apache NetBeans
:keywords: Apache NetBeans Platform, Platform Tutorials, NetBeans Platform CRUD Application Tutorial

This tutorial shows you how to integrate a MySQL database into a NetBeans Platform application. We start by exploring a MySQL database, for which we create an entity class. However, note that these instructions are not applicable to MySQL only. Rather, they are relevant to any relational database supported by NetBeans IDE. Next, we wrap the entity class into a module, together with modules for the related JPA JARS.

Once the above modules are part of our application, we create a new module that provides the user interface for our application. The new module gives the user a tree hierarchy showing data from the database. We then create another module that lets the user edit the data displayed by the first module. By separating the viewer from the editor in distinct modules, we will enable the user to install a different editor for the same viewer, since different editors could be created by external vendors, some commercially and some for free. It is this flexibility that the modular architecture of the NetBeans Platform makes possible.

Once we have an editor, we begin adding CRUD functionality. First, the "R", standing for "Read", is handled by the viewer described above. Next, the "U" for "Update" is handled, followed by the "C" for "Create", and the "D" for "Delete".

At the end of the tutorial, you will have learned about a range of NetBeans Platform features that help you in creating applications of this kind. For example, you will have learned about the  `` link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-awt/org/openide/awt/UndoRedo.Manager.html[UndoRedo.Manager]``  and the  `` link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-explorer/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerManager.html[ExplorerManager]`` , as well as NetBeans Platform Swing components, such as  `` link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html[TopComponent]``  and  `` link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-explorer/org/openide/explorer/view/BeanTreeView.html[BeanTreeView]`` .







The application you create in this tutorial will look as follows:


image::http://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/resource/states-manager-crud-application-gj.png[]

It is advisable to watch the screencast series  link:https://netbeans.apache.org/tutorials/nbm-10-top-apis.html[Top 10 NetBeans APIs] before beginning to work on this tutorial. Many of the concepts addressed in this tutorial are discussed in more detail within the screencast series.



== Setting up the Application

Let's start by creating a new NetBeans Platform application.


[start=1]
1. Choose File > New Project (Ctrl+Shift+N). Under Categories, select NetBeans Modules. Under Projects, select NetBeans Platform Application. Click Next.

[start=2]
1. In the Name and Location panel, type  ``DBManager``  in the Project Name field. Click Finish.

The IDE creates the  ``DBManager``  project. The project is a container for all the other modules you will create.


image::images/crud_dbmanager-1.png[]




== Integrating the Database

In order to integrate the database, you need to create entity classes from your database and integrate those entity classes, together with their related JARs, into modules that are part of your NetBeans Platform application.


=== Creating the Entity Classes

In this section, you generate entity classes from a selected database.


[start=1]
1. For purposes of this example, choose or create a "states" database, listing the US states, together with their abbreviations.


image::images/crud_dbmanager-2.png[]

Alternatively, use any database you like and adapt the steps that follow to your particular use case. For help with this step, see  link:https://netbeans.apache.org/kb/docs/ide/mysql.html[Connecting to a MySQL Database].


[start=2]
1. In the IDE, choose File | New Project, followed by Java | Java Class Library to create a new library project named  ``StatesLibrary`` .


[start=3]
1. In the Projects window, right-click the library project and choose File | New File, followed by Persistence | Entity Classes from Database. In the wizard, select EclipseLink in the step where you use the wizard to generate a persistence unit. Specify "demo" as the name of the package where the entity classes will be generated.

Once you have completed this step, look at the generated code and notice that, among other things, you now have a  ``persistence.xml``  file in a folder called META-INF, as well as entity classes for each of your tables:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-3.png[]


[start=4]
1. Build the Java Library and you will have a JAR file in the library project's "dist" folder, which you can view in the Files window:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-4.png[]


=== Wrapping the Entity Class JAR in a Module

In this section, you create a new NetBeans module that wraps the JAR file you created in the previous section.


[start=1]
1. Right-click the  ``DBManager`` 's Modules node in the Projects window and choose Add New Library.


[start=2]
1. Select the JAR you created in the previous subsection and complete the wizard, specifying any values you like.

You now have your first custom module in the new application:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-5.png[]


=== Creating Other Related Modules

In this section, you create two new modules, wrapping the EclipseLink JARs, as well as the database connector JAR.


[start=1]
1. Do the same as you did when creating the library wrapper for the entity class JAR, but this time for the EclipseLink JARs, which are in your GlassFish distro, make sure to include the persistence JAR that you find there too.

Use Ctrl-Click to select multiple JARs, as shown here:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-6.png[]

If you don't know which ones to include, go back to the library project created earlier and then expand the Libraries folder, which will show you which libraries you need.


[start=2]
1. Next, create yet another library wrapper module, this time for the MySQL connector JAR, which is available in the NetBeans IDE installation folder, within the  ``ide10/modules/ext``  folder.


=== Designing the User Interface

In this section, you create a simple prototype user interface, providing a window that uses a  ``JTextArea``  to display data retrieved from the database.


[start=1]
1. Right-click the  ``DBManager`` 's Modules node in the Projects window and choose Add New. Create a new module named  ``StatesViewer`` , with the code name base  ``org.demo.states.viewer`` .


[start=2]
1. In the Projects window, right-click the new module and choose New | Window Component. Specify that it should be created in the  ``editor``  position and that it should open when the application starts. Set  ``States``  as the window's class name prefix.


[start=3]
1. Use the Palette (Ctrl-Shift-8) to drag and drop a  ``JTextArea``  on the new window:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-7.png[]


[start=4]
1. Add this to the end of the TopComponent constructor:

[source,java]
----

EntityManager entityManager =  Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("StatesLibraryPU").createEntityManager();
Query query = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT c FROM States c");
List<States> resultList = query.getResultList();
for (States c : resultList) {
    jTextArea1.append(c.getName() + " (" + c.getAbbrev() + ")" + "\n");
}
----

Since you have not set dependencies on the modules that provide the States object and the persistence JARs, the statements above will be marked with red error underlines. These will be fixed in the section that follows.

Above, you can see references to a persistence unit named "StatesLibraryPU", which is the name set in the  ``persistence.xml``  file. In addition,there is a reference to one of the entity classes, called  ``States`` , which is in the entity classes module. Adapt these bits to your needs.


=== Setting Dependencies

In this section, you enable some of the modules to use code from some of the other modules. You do this very explicitly by setting intentional contracts between related modules, i.e., as opposed to the accidental and chaotic reuse of code that tends to happen when you do not have a strict modular architecture such as that provided by the NetBeans Platform.


[start=1]
1. The entity classes module needs to have dependencies on the MySQL module as well as on the EclipseLink module. Right-click the  ``StatesLibrary``  module, choose Properties, and use the Libraries tab to set dependencies on the two modules that the  ``StatesLibrary``  module needs.


[start=2]
1. The  ``StatesViewer``  module needs a dependency on the EclipseLink module as well as on the entity classes module. Right-click the  ``StatesViewer``  module, choose Properties, and use the Libraries tab to set dependencies on the two modules that the  ``StatesViewer``  module needs.


[start=3]
1. Open the  ``StatesTopComponent``  in the Source view, right-click in the editor, and choose "Fix Imports". The IDE is now able to add the required import statements, because the modules that provide the required classes are now available to the  ``StatesTopComponent`` .

You now have set contracts between the modules in your application, giving you control over the dependencies between distinct pieces of code.


=== Running the Prototype

In this section, you run the application so that you can see that you're correctly accessing your database.


[start=1]
1. Start your database server.


[start=2]
1. Run the application. You should see this:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-8.png[]

You now have a simple prototype, which you will extend in the next section.



== Integrating CRUD Functionality

In order to create CRUD functionality that integrates smoothly with the NetBeans Platform, some very specific NetBeans Platform coding patterns need to be implemented. The sections that follow describe these patterns in detail.


=== Read

In this section, you change the  ``JTextArea`` , introduced in the previous section, for a NetBeans Platform explorer view. NetBeans Platform explorer views are Swing components that integrate better with the NetBeans Platform than standard Swing components do. Representing your data you will have a generic hierarchical model provided by a NetBeans Platform  ``Node``  class, which can be displayed by any of the NetBeans Platform explorer views. This section ends with an explanation of how to synchronize your explorer view with the NetBeans Platform Properties window.


[start=1]
1. In your  ``TopComponent`` , delete the  ``JTextArea``  in the Design view and comment out its related code in the Source view:

[source,java]
----

EntityManager entityManager =  Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("StatesLibraryPU").createEntityManager();
Query query = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT c FROM States c");
List<States> resultList = query.getResultList();
//for (States c : resultList) {
//    jTextArea1.append(c.getName() + " (" + c.getAbbrev() + ")" + "\n");
//}
----


[start=2]
1. Right-click the  ``StatesViewer``  module, choose Properties, and use the Libraries tab to set dependencies on the Nodes API and the Explorer &amp; Property Sheet API.


[start=3]
1. Next, change the class signature to implement  ``ExplorerManager.Provider`` :

[source,java]
----

final class StatesTopComponent extends TopComponent implements ExplorerManager.Provider
----

You will need to override  ``getExplorerManager()`` 


[source,java]
----

@Override
public ExplorerManager getExplorerManager() {
    return em;
}
----

At the top of the class, declare and initialize the  ``ExplorerManager`` :


[source,java]
----

private static ExplorerManager em = new ExplorerManager();
----

Watch  link:https://netbeans.apache.org/tutorials/nbm-10-top-apis.html[Top 10 NetBeans APIs] for details on the above code, especially the screencast dealing with the Nodes API and the Explorer &amp; Property Sheet API.


[start=4]
1. Switch to the  ``TopComponent``  Design view, right-click in the Palette, choose Palette Manager | Add from JAR. Then browse to the  ``org-openide-explorer.jar`` , which is in  ``platform9/modules``  folder, within the NetBeans IDE installation directory. Choose the BeanTreeView and complete the wizard. You should now see  ``BeanTreeView``  in the Palette. Drag it from the Palette and drop it on the window.


[start=5]
1. Create a  ``Node``  that models your data:

[source,java]
----

import demo.States;
import java.util.List;
import org.openide.nodes.AbstractNode;
import org.openide.nodes.ChildFactory;
import org.openide.nodes.Children;
import org.openide.nodes.Node;

class StateChildFactory extends ChildFactory<States> {

    private List<States> resultList;

    public StateChildFactory(List<States> resultList) {

        this.resultList = resultList;
    }

    @Override
    protected boolean createKeys(List<States> list) {
        for (States states : resultList) {
            list.add(states);
        }
        return true;
    }

    @Override
    protected Node createNodeForKey(States s) {
        Node node = new AbstractNode(Children.LEAF);
        node.setDisplayName(s.getName());
        node.setShortDescription(s.getAbbrev());
        return node;
    }

}
----


[start=6]
1. Back in the  ``StatesTopComponent`` , use the  ``ExplorerManager``  to pass the result list from the JPA query in to the  ``Node`` :

[source,java]
----

EntityManager entityManager =  Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("StatesLibraryPU").createEntityManager();
Query query = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT c FROM States c");
List<States> resultList = query.getResultList();
*em.setRootContext(new AbstractNode(Children.create(new StateChildFactory(resultList), true)));*
//for (States c : resultList) {
//    jTextArea1.append(c.getName() + " (" + c.getAbbrev() + ")" + "\n");
//}
----


[start=7]
1. Run the application. Once the application is running, open the Properties window. Notice that even though the data is available, displayed in a  ``BeanTreeView`` , the  ``BeanTreeView``  is not synchronized with the Properties window, which is available via Window | Properties. In other words, nothing is displayed in the Properties window when you move up and down the tree hierarchy:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-9.png[]


[start=8]
1. Synchronize the Properties window with the  ``BeanTreeView``  by adding the following to the constructor in the  ``TopComponent`` :

[source,java]
----

ActionMap map = getActionMap();
associateLookup(ExplorerUtils.createLookup(em, map));
----

Here we add the  ``TopComponent`` 's  ``ActionMap``  and  ``ExplorerManager``  to the  ``Lookup``  of the  ``TopComponent`` . A side effect of this is that the Properties window starts displaying the display name and tooltip text of the selected  ``Node`` .


[start=9]
1. Run the application again and notice that the Properties window is now synchronized with the explorer view:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-10.png[]

Now you are able to view your data in a tree hierarchy, as you would be able to do with a  ``JTree`` . However, you're also able to swap in a different explorer view without needing to change the model at all because the  ``ExplorerManager``  mediates between the model and the view. Finally, you are now also able to synchronize the view with the Properties window.


=== Update

In this section, you first create an editor. The editor will be provided by a new NetBeans module. So, you will first create a new module. Then, within that new module, you will create a new  ``TopComponent`` , containing two  ``JTextFields`` , for each of the columns you want to let the user edit. You will need to let the viewer module communicate with the editor module. Whenever a new  ``Node``  is selected in the viewer module, you will add the current  ``States``  object to the  ``Lookup`` . In the editor module, you will listen to the  ``Lookup``  for the introduction of  ``States``  objects. Whenever a new  ``States``  object is introduced into the  ``Lookup`` , you will update the  ``JTextFields``  in the editor.

Next, you will synchronize your  ``JTextFields``  with the NetBeans Platform's Undo, Redo, and Save functionality. In other words, when the user makes changes to a  ``JTextField`` , you want the NetBeans Platform's existing functionality to become available so that, instead of needing to create new functionality, you'll simply be able to hook into the NetBeans Platform's support. To this end, you will need to use the  ``UndoRedoManager`` , together with the  ``SaveCookie`` .


[start=1]
1. Create a new module, named  ``StatesEditor`` , with  ``org.demo.states.editor``  as its code name base.


[start=2]
1. Right-click the  ``StatesEditor``  module and choose New | Window Component. Make sure to specify that the window should appear in the  ``editor``  position and that it should open when the application starts. In the final panel of the wizard, set "Editor" as the class name prefix.


[start=3]
1. Use the Palette (Ctrl-Shift-8) to add two  ``JLabels``  and two  ``JTextFields``  to the new window. Set the texts of the labels to "State" and "Abbreviation" and set the variable names of the two  ``JTextFields``  to  ``nameField``  and  ``abbrevField`` .

In the GUI Builder, the window should now look something like this:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-11.png[]


[start=4]
1. Go back to the  ``StatesViewer``  module and make sure that its  ``layer.xml``  file specifies that its window will appear in the  ``explorer``  mode.

Right-click the application project and choose "Clean", after changing the  ``layer.xml``  file. Why? Because whenever you run the application and close it down, the window positions are stored in the user directory. Therefore, if the  ``StatesViewer``  was initially displayed in the  ``editor``  mode, it will remain in the  ``editor``  mode, until you do a "Clean", thus resetting the user directory (i.e., thus _deleting_ the user directory) and enabling the  ``StatesViewer``  to be displayed in the position currently set in the  ``layer.xml``  file.

Also check that the  ``BeanTreeView``  in the  ``StatesViewer``  will stretch horizontally and vertically when the user resizes the application. Check this by opening the window, selecting the  ``BeanTreeView`` , and then clicking the arrow buttons in the toolbar of the GUI Builder.


[start=5]
1. Now we can start adding some code. Firstly, we need to show the currently selected States object in the editor:

* Start by tweaking the  ``StatesViewer``  module so that the current  ``States``  object is added to the viewer window's  ``Lookup``  whenever a new  ``Node``  is selected. Do this by changing the  ``Node``  created by the  ``StateChildFactory``  such that the current  ``States``  object is added to the  ``Lookup``  as follows (note the part in bold):

[source,java]
----

@Override
protected Node createNodeForKey(States s) {
    Node node = new AbstractNode(Children.LEAF*, Lookups.singleton(s)*);
    node.setDisplayName(s.getName());
    node.setShortDescription(s.getAbbrev());
    return node;
}
----

Now, whenever a new  ``Node``  is created, which happens when the user selects a new state in the viewer, a new  ``States``  object is added to the  ``Lookup``  of the  ``Node`` .

* Let's now change the editor module in such a way that its window will end up listening for  ``States``  objects being added to the  ``Lookup`` . First, set a dependency in the editor module on the module that provides the entity class, as well as the module that provides the persistence JARs.

* Next, change the  ``EditorTopComponent``  class signature to implement  ``LookupListener`` :

[source,java]
----

public final class EditorTopComponent extends TopComponent implements LookupListener
----

* Override the  ``resultChanged``  so that the  ``JTextFields``  are updated whenever a new  ``States``  object is introduced into the  ``Lookup`` :

[source,java]
----

@Override
public void resultChanged(LookupEvent lookupEvent) {
    Lookup.Result r = (Lookup.Result) lookupEvent.getSource();
    Collection<States> c = r.allInstances();
    if (!c.isEmpty()) {
        for (States s : c) {
            nameField.setText(s.getName());
            abbrevField.setText(s.getAbbrev());
        }
    } else {
        nameField.setText("[no state]");
        abbrevField.setText("[no abbreviation]");
    }
}
----

* Now that the  ``LookupListener``  is defined, we need to add it to something. Here, we add it to the  ``Lookup.Result``  obtained from the global context. The global context proxies the context of the selected  ``Node`` . For example, if "Missouri" is selected in the tree hierarchy, the  ``States``  object for "Missouri" is added to the  ``Lookup``  of the  ``Node``  which, because it is the currently selected  ``Node`` , means that the  ``States``  object for "Missouri" is now available in the global context. That is what is then passed to the  ``resultChanged`` , causing the text fields to be populated.

All of the above starts happening, i.e., the  ``LookupListener``  becomes active, whenever the editor window is opened, as you can see below:


[source,java]
----

@Override
public void componentOpened() {
    result = Utilities.actionsGlobalContext().lookupResult(States.class);
    result.addLookupListener(this);
    resultChanged(new LookupEvent(result));
}

@Override
public void componentClosed() {
    result.removeLookupListener(this);
    result = null;
}
----

Since the editor window is opened when the application starts, the  ``LookupListener``  is available at the time that the application starts up.

* Finally, declare the result variable at the top of the class, like this:

[source,java]
----

private Lookup.Result result = null;
----

* Run the application again and notice that the editor window is updated whenever you select a new  ``Node`` :


image::images/crud_dbmanager-12.png[]

However, notice what happens when you switch to the editor window:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-13.png[]

Because the  ``Node``  is no longer current, the  ``States``  object is no longer in the global context. This is the case because, as pointed out above, the global context proxies the  ``Lookup``  of the current  ``Node`` . Therefore, in this case, we cannot use the global context. Instead, we will use the local  ``Lookup``  provided by the States window.

Rewrite this line:


[source,java]
----

result = Utilities.actionsGlobalContext().lookupResult(States.class);
----

To this:


[source,java]
----

result = WindowManager.getDefault().findTopComponent("StatesTopComponent").getLookup().lookupResult(States.class);
----

The string "StatesTopComponent" is the ID of the  ``StatesTopComponent`` , which is a string constant that you can find in the source code of the  ``StatesTopComponent`` . One drawback of the approach above is that now our  ``EditorTopComponent``  only works if it can find a  ``TopComponent``  with the ID "StatesTopComponent". Either this needs to be explicitly documented, so that developers of alternative editors can know that they need to identify the viewer  ``TopComponent``  this way, or you need to rewrite the selection model,  link:http://weblogs.java.net/blog/timboudreau/archive/2007/01/how_to_replace.html[as described here] by Tim Boudreau.

If you take one of the above approaches, you will find that the context is not lost when you switch to the  ``EditorTopComponent`` , as shown below:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-14.png[]


[start=6]
1. Secondly, let's work on the Undo/Redo functionality. What we'd like to have happen is that whenever the user makes a change to one of the  ``JTextFields`` , the "Undo" button and the "Redo" button, as well as the related menu items in the Edit menu, become enabled. To that end, the NetBeans Platform makes the  link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-awt/org/openide/awt/UndoRedo.Manager.html[UndoRedo.Manager] available.

* Declare and instantiate a new UndoRedoManager at the top of the  ``EditorTopComponent`` :

[source,java]
----

private UndoRedo.Manager manager = new UndoRedo.Manager();
----

* Next, override the  ``getUndoRedo()``  method in the  ``EditorTopComponent`` :

[source,java]
----

@Override
public UndoRedo getUndoRedo() {
    return manager;
}
----

* In the constructor of the  ``EditorTopComponent`` , add a  ``KeyListener``  to the  ``JTextFields``  and, within the related methods that you need to implement, add the  ``UndoRedoListeners`` :

[source,java]
----

nameField.addKeyListener(new KeyListener() {

    public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
    }

    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
    }

    public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
    }

});

abbrevField.addKeyListener(new KeyListener() {

    public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
    }

    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
    }

    public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
    }

});
----

* Run the application and show the Undo and Redo functionality in action, the buttons as well as the menu items:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-15.png[]

The functionality works exactly as you would expect. You might want to change the  ``KeyListener``  so that not ALL keys cause the undo/redo functionality to be enabled. For example, when Enter is pressed, you probably do not want the undo/redo functionality to become available. Therefore, tweak the code above to suit your business requirements.


[start=7]
1. Thirdly, we need to integrate with the NetBeans Platform's Save functionality:

* By default, the "Save All" button is available in the NetBeans Platform toolbar. In our current scenario, we do not want to save "all", because "all" refers to a number of different documents. In our case, we only have one "document", which is the editor that we are reusing for all the nodes in the tree hirerarchy. Remove the "Save All" button and add the "Save" button instead, by adding the following to the layer file of the  ``StatesEditor``  module:

[source,xml]
----

<folder name="Toolbars">
    <folder name="File">
        <file name="org-openide-actions-SaveAllAction.instance_hidden"/>
        <file name="org-openide-actions-SaveAction.instance"/>
    </folder>
</folder>
----

When you now run the application, you will see a different icon in the toolbar. Instead of the "Save All" button, you now have the "Save" button available.

* Set dependencies on the Dialogs API and the Nodes API.

* Create a new  ``Node`` . We will call it "DummyNode", since it is only a  ``Node``  in so far as that is how Save functionality is added to a NetBeans Platform application, i.e., by creating a new  ``Node`` , one that adds new implementations of  ``SaveCookie``  to its set of capabilities, which is then set as the activated  ``Node``  of the  ``TopComponent`` .

[source,java]
----

private class DummyNode extends AbstractNode {

    SaveCookieImpl impl;

    public DummyNode() {
        super(Children.LEAF);
        impl = new SaveCookieImpl();
    }

    public void fire(boolean modified) {
        if (modified) {
            *//If the text is modified,
            //we implement SaveCookie,
            //and add the implementation to the cookieset,
            //which defines the capabilities of the Node,
            //in this case, the capability of being saved:*
            getCookieSet().assign(SaveCookie.class, impl);
        } else {
            *//Otherwise, we make no assignment
            //and the SaveCookie is not set as
            //one of the capabilities of the Node:*
            getCookieSet().assign(SaveCookie.class);
        }
    }

    private class SaveCookieImpl implements SaveCookie {

        public void save() throws IOException {

            Confirmation msg = new NotifyDescriptor.Confirmation("Do you want to save \"" +
                    nameField.getText() + " (" + abbrevField.getText() + ") " + "\"?",
                    NotifyDescriptor.OK_CANCEL_OPTION,
                    NotifyDescriptor.QUESTION_MESSAGE);

            Object result = DialogDisplayer.getDefault().notify(msg);

            *//When the user clicks "Yes", indicating they really want to save,
            //we need to disable the Save button and Save menu item,
            //so that it will only be usable when the next change is made
            //to the text field:*
            if (NotifyDescriptor.YES_OPTION.equals(result)) {
                fire(false);
                *//We will add the Save handling code here.*
            }

        }
    }
}
----

* Declare the  ``Node``  at the top of the  ``TopComponent``  class:

[source,java]
----

private DummyNode dummyNode;
----

Now, in the constructor of the  ``TopComponent`` , add it to the  ``TopComponent`` 's activated nodes:


[source,java]
----

setActivatedNodes(new Node[]{dummyNode = new DummyNode()});
----

* Next, we need to fire a change in the  ``DummyNode``  whenever a change is made in the  ``JTextFields`` , which in turn adds an implementation of  ``SaveCookie``  to the capabilities of the activated  ``Node`` , which is our "DummyNode":

[source,java]
----

nameField.addKeyListener(new KeyListener() {

    public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        *dummyNode.fire(true);*
    }

    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        *dummyNode.fire(true);*
    }

    public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        *dummyNode.fire(true);*
    }
    
});

abbrevField.addKeyListener(new KeyListener() {

    public void keyTyped(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        *dummyNode.fire(true);*
    }

    public void keyPressed(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        *dummyNode.fire(true);*
    }

    public void keyReleased(KeyEvent e) {
        nameField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        abbrevField.getDocument().addUndoableEditListener(manager);
        *dummyNode.fire(true);*
    }

});
----

* Run the application and notice the enablement/disablement of the Save button:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-16.png[]

Right now, nothing happens when you click OK in the dialog above. In the next step, we add some JPA code for handling persistence of our changes.

* Next, we add JPA code for persisting our change. Do so by replacing the comment "//We will add the Save handling code here." The comment should be replaced by all of the following:

[source,java]
----

EntityManager entityManager = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("StatesLibraryPU").createEntityManager();
entityManager.getTransaction().begin();
States states = entityManager.find(States.class, s.getId());
states.setName(nameField.getText());
states.setAbbrev(abbrevField.getText());
entityManager.getTransaction().commit();
----

The "s" in  ``s.getId()``  is currently undefined. Redefine the  ``resultChanged``  as follows, after declaring  ``States s;``  at the top of the class, so that the current  ``States``  object sets the  ``s`` , which is then used in the persistence code above to obtain the ID of the current  ``States``  object.


[source,java]
----

@Override
public void resultChanged(LookupEvent lookupEvent) {
    Lookup.Result r = (Lookup.Result) lookupEvent.getSource();
    Collection<States> c = r.allInstances();
    if (!c.isEmpty()) {
        for (States states : c) {
            s = states;
            nameField.setText(states.getName());
            abbrevField.setText(states.getAbbrev());
        }
    } else {
        nameField.setText("[no state]");
        abbrevField.setText("[no abbreviation]");
    }
}
----

* Run the application and change some data. Currently, we have no "Refresh" functionality so, to see the changed data, restart the application. Here, for example, the tree hierarchy shows the persisted state name for "Missouri":


image::images/crud_dbmanager-17.png[]


[start=8]
1. Fourthly, we need to add functionality for refreshing the States viewer. You might want to add a  ``Timer``  which periodically refreshes the viewer. However, in this example, we will add a "Refresh" menu item to the Root node so that the user will be able to manually refresh the viewer.

* In the main package of the  ``StatesViewer``  module, create a new  ``Node`` , which will replace the  ``AbstractNode``  that we are currently using as the root of the children in the viewer. Note that we also bind a "Refresh" action to our new root node.

[source,java]
----

class StatesRootNode extends AbstractNode {

    public StatesRootNode(Children kids) {
        super(kids);
        setDisplayName("Root");
    }

    @Override
    public Action[] getActions(boolean context) {
        Action[] result = new Action[]{
            new RefreshAction()};
        return result;
    }

    private final class RefreshAction extends AbstractAction {

        public RefreshAction() {
            putValue(Action.NAME, "Refresh");
        }

        public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            StatesTopComponent.refreshNode();
        }
    }

}
----

* Add this method to the  ``StatesTopComponent`` , for refreshing the view:

[source,java]
----

public static void refreshNode() {
    EntityManager entityManager = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("StatesLibraryPU").createEntityManager();
    Query query = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT c FROM States c");
    List<States> resultList = query.getResultList();
    em.setRootContext(new *StatesRootNode*(Children.create(new StateChildFactory(resultList), true)));
}
----

Now replace the code above in the constructor of the  ``StatesTopComponent``  with a call to the above. As you can see in the highlighted part above, we are now using our  ``StatesRootNode``  instead of the  ``AbstractNode`` . The  ``StatesRootNode``  includes the "Refresh" action, which calls the code above.

* Run the application again and notice that you have a new root node, with a "Refresh" action:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-18.png[]

* Make a change to some data, save it, invoke the Refresh action, and notice that the viewer is updated.

You have now learned how to let the NetBeans Platform handle changes to the  ``JTextFields`` . Whenever the text changes, the NetBeans Platform Undo and Redo buttons are enabled or disabled. Also, the Save button is enabled and disabled correctly, letting the user save changed data back to the database.


=== Create

In this section, you allow the user to create a new entry in the database.


[start=1]
1. Right-click the  ``StatesEditor``  module and choose "New Action". Use the New Action wizard to create a new "Always Enabled" action. The new action should be displayed in the toolbar and in the menu bar.


image::images/crud_dbmanager-19.png[]

In the next step of the wizard, call the action  ``NewAction`` :


image::images/crud_dbmanager-20.png[]

Make sure that you have a 16x16 icon available, which the wizard forces you to select if you indicate that you want the action to be invoked from the toolbar.


[start=2]
1. In the New action, let the  ``TopComponent``  be opened, together with emptied  ``JTextFields`` :

[source,java]
----

import java.awt.event.ActionEvent;
import java.awt.event.ActionListener;

public final class NewAction implements ActionListener {

    public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
        EditorTopComponent tc = EditorTopComponent.getDefault();
        tc.resetFields();
        tc.open();
        tc.requestActive();
    }

}
----

The action implements the  ``ActionListener``  class, which is bound to the application via entries in the layer file, put there by the New Action wizard. Imagine how easy it will be when you port your existing Swing application to the NetBeans Platform, since you'll simply be able to use the same  ``Action``  classes that you used in your original application, without needing to rewrite them to conform to  ``Action``  classes provided by the NetBeans Platform!

In the  ``EditorTopComponent`` , add the following method for resetting the  ``JTextFields``  and creating a new  ``States``  object:


[source,java]
----

public void resetFields() {
    s = new States();
    nameField.setText("");
    abbrevField.setText("");
}
----


[start=3]
1. In the  ``SaveCookie`` , ensure that a return of  ``null``  indicates that a new entry is saved, instead of an existing entry being updated:

[source,java]
----

public void save() throws IOException {

    Confirmation msg = new NotifyDescriptor.Confirmation("Do you want to save \"" +
            nameField.getText() + " (" + abbrevField.getText() + ") " + "\"?", NotifyDescriptor.OK_CANCEL_OPTION,
            NotifyDescriptor.QUESTION_MESSAGE);

    Object result = DialogDisplayer.getDefault().notify(msg);

    //When user clicks "Yes", indicating they really want to save,
    //we need to disable the Save button and Save menu item,
    //so that it will only be usable when the next change is made
    //to the text field:
    if (NotifyDescriptor.YES_OPTION.equals(result)) {
        fire(false);
        EntityManager entityManager = Persistence.createEntityManagerFactory("StatesLibraryPU").createEntityManager();
        entityManager.getTransaction().begin();
        *if (s.getId() != null)* {
            States states = entityManager.find(States.class, s.getId());
            states.setName(nameField.getText());
            states.setAbbrev(abbrevField.getText());
            entityManager.getTransaction().commit();
        } else {
            *Query query = entityManager.createQuery("SELECT c FROM States c");
            List<States> resultList = query.getResultList();
            s.setId(resultList.size()+1);
            s.setName(nameField.getText());
            s.setAbbrev(abbrevField.getText());
            entityManager.persist(s);
            entityManager.getTransaction().commit();*
        }
    }

}
----


[start=4]
1. Run the application again and add a new state to the database:


image::images/crud_dbmanager-21.png[]

When you refresh the data, you will find that new entries are added to the bottom of the list, because they are sorted by their ID number. So, "Disneyland" is added right at the end, rather than in its alphabetical position.


=== Delete

In this section, let the user delete a selected entry in the database. Using the concepts and code outlined above, implement the Delete action yourself.


[start=1]
1. Create a new action,  ``DeleteAction`` . Decide whether you want to bind it to a State node or whether you'd rather bind it to the toolbar, the menu bar, or both. Depending on where you bind it, you will need to use a different NetBeans Platform class. Read the tutorial again for help, especially by looking at how the "New" action was created, while comparing it to the "Refresh" action on the root node.


[start=2]
1. Get the current  ``States``  object, return an 'Are you sure?' dialog, and then delete the entry. For help on this point, read the tutorial again, focusing on the part where the "Save" functionality is implemented. Instead of saving, you now want to delete an entry from the database.
