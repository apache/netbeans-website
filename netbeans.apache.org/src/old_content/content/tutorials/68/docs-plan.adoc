:description: NetBeans 5.0 FCS Status of Docs Deliverables for NetBeans Plug-in Modules - Apache NetBeans
:keywords: Apache NetBeans Platform, Platform Tutorials, NetBeans 5.0 FCS Status of Docs Deliverables for NetBeans Plug-in Modules

link:mailto:dev@netbeans.apache.org?subject=Feedback:%20NetBeans%20IDE%20Docs%20Plan%20for%20NetBeans%20Modules[Feedback]

Below are all the deliverables for developer docs which the docs department was aware of when planning docs for rich-client application developers and plug-in module developers. All deliverables marked *P1* or *P2* were the deliverables to which the docs department commited itself for FCS. All the other deliverables were "nice to have", but no more than that.

Explanation of the statuses at time of FCS:

* *Planned* means writing has not started, and the related sample -- if any -- has not been put together, but that the basic idea of the deliverable in question is clear and that developers have been identified for help, if necessary.
* *Started* means that the sample for the deliverable -- if any -- is being put together and the deliverable has begun to be written but neither have reached a point where they are solid enough to be reviewed.
* *First draft* means that the deliverable is available for public consumption -- the steps in the deliverable provide the technical result (i.e., the plug-in works) although there are probably various issues to be solved; there is no conceptual information; the sample code may or may not be attached to the tutorial; the full 4.next features aren't covered.
* *Final draft* means that all the 4.next functionality (or, whatever is available at the time) is included in the deliverable, that it includes complete conceptual information, that it has had editorial reviews and technical reviews. Until Frozen status, small tweaks can be added, as well as additional functionality that was added late, but no more.
* *Frozen* means frozen, i.e., absolutely no more changes. Next changes to be added will be part of the next release cycle.
