:description: NetBeans Platform Runtime Container Tutorial - Apache NetBeans
:keywords: Apache NetBeans Platform, Platform Tutorials, NetBeans Platform Runtime Container Tutorial

This tutorial covers the most fundamental concept in the NetBeans Platform—the runtime container. The runtime container is the execution environment for the modules that define a NetBeans Platform application. It consists of 5 modules provided by the NetBeans Platform. In this tutorial, we will look at these 5 modules, and use them in a very simple modular application.

Before going further, you can watch this video, which covers the same material as the rest of this tutorial:






== Introduction to the Runtime Container

The "NetBeans runtime container" is the collective name for these 5 NetBeans Platform modules:

Brief overview of each of these 5 modules:

* Bootstrap—Enables the runtime container to understand what a module is and how to load and compose them into one application.
* Startup—Provides the main method of your application, as well as all the code needed for starting it up.
* Filesystem API—Gives your application a filesystem.
* Module System API—Lets you influence the lifecycle of the modules in your application.
* Utilities API—Includes many utility classes, especially the Lookup class, which is used for communication between modules.


== Setting up the Runtime Container

In this section, we will create an absolutely minimal NetBeans Platform application. It will consist of only those modules that every NetBeans Platform application must have—the 5 modules that make up the runtime container. Once we have create an application that consists of nothing more than these 5 modules, we will run it. There will be no specific output from this application. However, it will build and run successfully because all the fundamental requirements of a NetBeans Platform application will have been met.


[start=1]
1. Go to File > New Project. In the New Project dialog, choose NetBeans Modules > NetBeans Platform Application:

Click Next.


[start=2]
1. Name your application 'Hello World'. Click Finish.

[start=3]
1. Right-click the main project node in the Projects window, choose Properties, and go to the Libraries tab. There you can see all the modules that are part of this application.

[start=4]
1. In addition to the runtime container, many other modules are included. Exclude them now. Make sure that ONLY the 5 modules that make up the runtime container are included.

Run the application and notice that the application successfully executes.


== Loading a New Module into the Runtime Container

In this section, we add one new module to the NetBeans runtime container. The new module will do nothing special. The only reason for adding it will be so that you can see that it will be an equal partner to the other modules in your application. You will have six modules instead of 5: in addition to the 5 modules that you already have, you will also have your custom module.

Next, we will influence the module's lifecycle. When it is loaded into the runtime container, we will use one of the module's lifecycle methods to send a 'Hello World' message to the Output window.


[start=1]
1. Right-click the application's Modules node and choose 'Add New...'. Click Next.

[start=2]
1. Give your module a project name and a code name base. Click Finish. You now have a new module.

[start=3]
1. Right-click the module, choose New > Other, and then choose Module Development > Module Installer. Click Next and then complete the wizard. You now have a new class that extends 'ModuleInstaller', which is from the Module System API.

[start=4]
1. Add a new 'System.out.println' message in the 'restored' method of the Installer class.

Run the application again and notice the 'Hello World' message in the application's output. One place where you can see the application's output is in the IDE's Output window.
