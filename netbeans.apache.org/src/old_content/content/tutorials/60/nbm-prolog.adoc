Welcome to the NetBeans Platform Schliemann tutorial. Schliemann is a project that allows you to define a programming language and integrate it to NetBeans IDE.

This tutorial shows how to add Prolog support to the NetBeans Editor. At the end of it, your prolog files in NetBeans IDE will look like that:

== Prerequisite Knowledge

You are neither required to know anything about NetBeans Platform develop ment nor Prolog to work on this tutorial. We have choose Prolog as example for Schliemann because of the relative simplicity of its syntax.


== Required Software

Since the version 6.0, the Generic Language Framework Studio is part of the distribution of NetBeans IDE. Therefore, the only software needed to go through this tutorial is:

* The J2SE(TM) Development Kit (JDK), version 5.0 or compatible ( link:https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[download the most recent JDK]).
* NetBeans IDE 6.0 ( link:https://netbeans.apache.org/download/index.html[download]).



== Setting up the environment

Take the following steps to set up the environment, before to begin to add Prolog support:


[start=1]
1. In the IDE, create a New Project and choose the type Module, in the category NetBeans Modules.

[start=2]
1. Name the project whatever you like (we use the name Prolog, in this tutorial) and finish.

[start=3]
1. Add a new file to your project of type Language Support. You can find this type in the category Module Development. We name this file "prolog", and the extesion is "nbs" (NetBeans Scripting). You will be also asked to provide a Mime Type and a list of extensions. In this tutorial we use  ``text/x-prolog``  as Mime Type and  ``pro``  as extension.

After those steps you should see the following files and NBS Template in your NetBeans IDE


image::images/prolog_60-setting.png[] 

The file  ``MIMEResolver.xml``  maps the "pro" file extension to the MIME type  ``text/x-prolog`` .


== Adding Prolog support to NetBeans Editor

The NBS default template contains code for an example language definition. If you compile and install the module now (right click on the project and select "Install/Reload in Development IDE"), after restarting the IDE you can try to create a new file with "pro" extension and paste the following code in it:


[source,java]
----


while (one) {
   two
   if (three) {
      four
   }
}
while (five) {
   six
}

----

You will notice syntax coloring, navigator window support, code folding and indentation. Now we begin to add Prolog support, so, the first step is deleting all the content of the file  ``prolog.nbs`` .


=== Tokens definition

The lexical analyser is the first part of any language definition. In Schliemann tokens are defined by regular expressions and the keyword  ``TOKEN``  is used. In the case of Prolog, the tokens that we define are the following:


[source,java]
----

    [ "?"  "/" "*"  "-" "+"  "@" "#" "$" "%" "^" "\\"
    ]
)

    [ "<" ">" "=" ","  ";"  "&amp;" "~" "|"
    ]
)

TOKEN:separator: ( ["(" ")" "[" "]" "{" "}"] )

TOKEN:variable:( ["A"-"Z" "_"] ["a"-"z" "A"-"Z" "0"-"9" "_"]* )
TOKEN:identifier:( ["a"-"z"] ["a"-"z" "A"-"Z" "0"-"9" "_"]* )
TOKEN:number:(  ["0"-"9"]+   ("." ["0"-"9"]+)? ("E" ("+" | "-" )? ["0"-"9"]+)? )
TOKEN:whitespace: ( [" " "\t" "\n" "\r"]* )
TOKEN:comment:( "/*" - "*/" )
TOKEN:line_comment:( "%" [^ "\n" "\r"]* ["\n" "\r"]+ )

----

Notice that it is possible to define different tokens with the same name, like  ``string`` . In this way we can apply the same processing to two different kinds of string but that semantically are identical.

For more detailed info on the syntax of tokens definition, take a look on the official Schliemann Language Definition,  link:http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/SchliemannNBSLanguageDescription#section-SchliemannNBSLanguageDescription-TokensDefinition.[here].

For Prolog we have defined one token  ``keyword`` , that obviously represents the keywords of the language, one token  ``function`` , representing the predefined functions that exist in Prolog and the usual tokens  ``string`` ,  ``operator`` ,  ``number`` ,  ``identifier``  or  ``variable``  (all the variables in Prolog must begin with capital letter or _). Also you can find tokens describing comments (line and block) and whitespaces. This kind of tokens should receive a special treatment.

With the definition of tokens it is possible now to add syntax coloring. We can do that with this small piece of code:


[source,java]
----


# Syntax Coloring
COLOR:function: {
    default_coloring:"default";
    font_type:"bold";
}

COLOR:line_comment: {
    default_coloring:"comment";
}

COLOR:list: {
    default_coloring:"string";
}

----

It is not necessary to specify a color for  ``keyword`` ,  ``function`` , etc, because there exists a default color for the tokens defined as keywords, or comments, or operator. Of course, it is possible to override the default syntax coloring. It is also possible to change other properties, like the font or the background color. For more info, take a look  link:http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/SchliemannNBSLanguageDescription#section-SchliemannNBSLanguageDescription-SyntaxColoringDefinition.[here].

Copy and paste all the code above in your NBS file. If you install now the module in you Development IDE and restart NetBeans, you can see syntax coloring in a Prolog example file.


image::images/prolog_60-tokens.png[]


=== Grammar definition

First, comments and whitespaces should be ignored by the syntax analyser. This is achieved by using the keyword  ``skip`` .


[source,java]
----


SKIP:comment
SKIP:line_comment
SKIP:whitespace

----

At this point, it is important to speak about the AST View and the Tokens View. These two views provided by the IDE are really useful when you are using Schliemann, actually, they are essential if you want to debug your grammar or your tokens definition.

To activate them, right-click the file  ``prolog.nbs``  in the Project window and select "AST View" and "Tokens View". Now, you should see the AST and the Tokens browser window. If you select now your prolog example file, while leaving the Tokens view open, you should see the tokens of this file. These two views always show the AST and tokens of the currently selected file.

An example of the Tokens View and AST View in action:


image::images/prolog_60-tokensview.png[] 


In Schliemann, grammar is described in form similar to JavaCC (extended  link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backus�Naur_form[BNF]). The grammar must be  link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LL_parser[LL], since  link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LR_parser[LR] and  link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LALR[LALR] grammar are not accepted.

There are some things that you should have into account when you are writing a grammar for Schliemann. First of all, the grammar should be LL(1) (that means that the parser can only look ahead one symbol when analyzing text). So if you have rules whose right hand sides start with the same element, you should transform these rules. For example, instead of writing:


[source,java]
----


Statement = Fact | Clause;
Fact = Structure ".";
Clause = Structure ":-" ListOfStructures ".";

----

which will not work properly, you should write something like that:


[source,java]
----


Statement = Structure ("." | ":-" ListOfStructures ".");

----

Also, you must remove left recursion in your grammar, which implies that you cannot have rules like that:


[source,java]
----


ListOfStructures = ListOfStructures BooleanOperation Structure;
ListOfStructures = Structure;

----

but you should re-write the above as follows:


[source,java]
----


ListOfStructures = Structure (BooleanOperation Structure)* ;

----

As a result of those transformations, the grammar you write is less strict than the original syntax definition of the language, don't worry. You are not writing a compiler, so, if your grammar is not powerful enough to detect all the possible syntax errors, it is also OK.

Last, but not least, be patient. Schliemann is not a tool to write compilers, like ANTLR or yacc. It has some limitations and sometimes, if you have some errors in your tokens definition or in your grammar, you will not get any information about it. The error messages provide not really useful information and you should work out by inspection of your .nbs file or by trial and error.

After these remarks, we can go on to the grammar for Prolog. The syntax of prolog is deceptively simple. A logic program is made up of clauses and facts. A simplified definition of the grammar:


[source,java]
----


clause := predicate ":-" (predicate)+ "."
fact := predicate "."

----

Predicates can be function symbols with or without arguments or infix binary operators like "=". Aritmetic expressions can also appear. For more detail on Prolog there are several resources like  link:http://www.csupomona.edu/~jrfisher/www/prolog_tutorial/contents.html[this] or  link:http://kti.mff.cuni.cz/~bartak/prolog.old/index.html[this], but for the purpose of this tutorial it is not important to understand deeply the Prolog syntax.

The complete Schliemann code that defines the prolog syntax is the following:


[source,java]
----


# Grammar definition

S = (Statement)*;

Statement = Structure ("." | ":-" ListOfStructures ".");


ListOfStructures = Structure (BooleanOperation Structure)* ;

Structure = Expression |  
            ;

Functor =  | ;

Expression = BaseExpression ((Operation|"is"|"mod"|"rem") Expression)* |
            "(" BaseExpression ((Operation|"is"|"mod"|"rem") Expression)* ")" ;

Operation = ()+;
BooleanOperation = ()+ | "=.." | ","; 

BaseExpression =  | 
                 | 
                 | 
                Function |
                 ;

Function = Functor ["(" ListOfStructures ")"];

----

Copy and paste the code above.


=== Folding, navigation and other features

The tokens and grammar definition is the core of our Prolog support. Now, we can go on to more interesting and easy stuff. Copy and paste all the code below in your NBS file:


[source,java]
----


# error highlighting
MARK:ERROR: {
    type:"Error";
    message:"Syntax error.";
}

MARK:error: {
    type:"Error";
    message:"Unexpected character.";
}

# brace completion
COMPLETE "{:}"
COMPLETE "(:)"
COMPLETE "[:]"
COMPLETE "\":\""
COMPLETE "\':\'"

# brace matching
BRACE "{:}"
BRACE "(:)"
BRACE "[:]"
BRACE "\":\""
BRACE "\':\'"

# indentation
INDENT ".*(((:-)\\s*)[^.]*)"

# code folding 
FOLD:ListOfStructures: {
    expand_type_action_name:"Expand clause body";
    collapse_type_action_name:"Collapse clause body";
}

FOLD:comment: {
    expand_type_action_name:"Expand Comments";
    collapse_type_action_name:"Collapse Comments";
}

# navigator support
NAVIGATOR:Statement: {
    display_name: "$Structure$";
    icon: org.yourorghere.prolog.Prolog.statementIcon;
}

----

Thanks to our definition of the language, we can detect both lexical and syntactic errors and we can get these error marked. Also, add code folding is quite easy. In our case, we just add code folding for block comments and clauses. Any grammar rule can be folded.

As you can see, brace completion and brace matching are pretty intuitive. To add indentation is enough to write some regular expression after which the code should be automatically indented. The most interesting thing in this code is the navigator support. For every prolog statement, we display the text corresponding to the structure and the icon used depends on the kind of statement we are dealing with (fact or clause). To do that, the  ``icon``  declaration refers to a method called  ``statementIcon`` , which is in the file  ``Prolog.java`` . Here is the content of that file:


[source,java]
----


package org.yourorghere.prolog;

import org.netbeans.api.languages.ASTNode;
import org.netbeans.api.languages.ASTPath;
import org.netbeans.api.languages.SyntaxContext;

public class Prolog {
   
    
    public static String statementIcon (SyntaxContext context) {
        ASTPath path = context.getASTPath ();
        ASTNode node = (ASTNode) path.getLeaf ();
        node = node.getNode ("ListOfStructures");
        if (node != null) {
            return "/org/netbeans/modules/languages/resources/variable.gif";
        }

        return "/org/netbeans/modules/languages/resources/method.gif";
    }


}

----

To get this file working, you have to add a module dependency with the Generic Languages Framework. To do this, in the Projects Window, right click on "Libraries" and select "Add Module Dependency..." and then look for the Generic Languages Framework. That method makes use of the AST generated by Schliemann. Basically, we search in the path whose root is a Statement node, another node of type  ``ListOfStructures`` . If this node is found, that means that the statement is a clause. Otherwise, it is a fact. This procedure can be also applied to the  ``display_name``  declaration and so on.
