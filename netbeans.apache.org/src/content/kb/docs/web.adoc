== *What Are Web Services?*

Web services are distributed application components that are externally available. You can use them to integrate computer applications that are written in different languages and run on different platforms. Web services are language and platform independent because vendors have agreed on common web service standards.

Web service applications are deployed to a Java EE application server, such as GlassFish / Sun Java System Application Server.

This page provides links to some of the NetBeans documents and resources that can help you learn how to develop web service applications with NetBeans IDE.
