|This screencast demonstrates how to create and debug a TestNG test class in NetBeans IDE. In the screencast you create a simple TestNG test and create a data provider in the test class to supply the parameters used in the test. The screencast also demonstrates using the Step Over Expression command when debugging the test class.
