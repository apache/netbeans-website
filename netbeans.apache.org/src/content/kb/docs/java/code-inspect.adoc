=== Verifying Java Code against NetBeans Java Hints

The  ``NetBeans Java Hints``  configuration available in the IDE enables you to verify if the predefined coding standard rules are satisfied by the source code under consideration. In other words, it applies a set of NetBeans Java Hints (also known as code inspections) to your Java source files.

*To run the  ``NetBeans Java Hints``  configuration, complete the following steps:*

. Choose Source > Inspect from the main IDE's toolbar.
. In the Scope drop-down list of the Inspect dialog box, select  ``Open Projects``  (if you have only one  ``library``  project open in the IDE) or  ``Current Project (library)`` .

NOTE: You can define a scope (a file, package, or project(s)) for the  ``NetBeans Java Hints``  configuration.

[start=3]
. Select the Configuration radio button and choose  ``NetBeans Java Hints``  in the drop-down list.

=== Finding Potential Problems in Java Code with FindBugs

The  ``FindBugs``  configuration available in the IDE enables you to find a wide range of potential problems in your code. It invokes the popular open source FindBugs tool for code analysis in Java. The bug report gets generated and is displayed in the Inspector Window of the NetBeans IDE, which categorizes all the found problems and allows direct navigation from the bugs in the report to the suspicious code. You can also read a bug description in the adjacent window or review it at the link:http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/bugDescriptions.html[+FindBugs Bug Descriptions+] page by the pointer provided at the top of the left frame.

NOTE: You need to install the <<plugin,FindBugs>> plugin to run this configuration for the first time.

*To identify potential errors in your Java code with the  ``FindBugs``  configuration, complete the following steps:*

. Open the  ``library``  project in the NetBeans IDE and choose Source > Inspect from the main toolbar.
. In the Scope drop-down list of the Inspect dialog box, select  ``Current Project (library)`` .

NOTE: You can inspect a file, package, or project(s) with the  ``FindBugs``  configuration.

[start=3]
. In the Inspect dialog box, select the  ``FindBugs``  configuration.
