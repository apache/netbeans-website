==== Developing C, C++, and Fortran Applications

When you install the NetBeans IDE with C/C++ support, the IDE includes project types for C and C++ and appropriate templates. You can create C, C++, and Fortran applications with dynamic and static libraries, and you can also create C/C++/Fortran projects from existing sources. The editor indents, completes, and syntax-highlights C and C++ code and is well integrated with the GNU gdb debugger.
