|This screencast demonstrates the support for the Oracle WebLogic server in NetBeans IDE. The screencast demonstrates how to register an instance of the server with the IDE and then deploy a Java EE 5 web application. The IDE can automatically generate and configure the WebLogic descriptor file and deploy required JDBC drivers to the server. You also have the option of enabling JavaServer Faces 2.0 libraries on the server from the IDE.
