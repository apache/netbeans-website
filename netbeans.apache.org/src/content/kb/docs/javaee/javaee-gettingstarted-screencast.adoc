|This screencast demonstrates the support provided by NetBeans IDE for some of the technologies introduced as part of Java Enterprise Edition 6 (Java EE 6) specification. The screencast demonstrates how to use wizards in the IDE to create a simple Java EE 6 web application that contains an EJB 3.1 stateless session bean facade for an entity class. You then see how to create a JSF managed bean that accesses the session facade and some JSF 2.0 pages.
