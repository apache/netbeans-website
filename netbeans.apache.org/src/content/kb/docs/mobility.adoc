== What is a Mobile Application? 

Most mobile applications use the Java Micro Edition (Java ME) platform, which was developed for small devices like mobile phones, but is now used on a wide variety of devices. Java ME uses scaled down subsets of Java SE components, virtual machines and APIs. It also defines APIs that are specifically targeted at consumer mobile and embedded devices. NetBeans IDE supports link:http://www.oracle.com/us/technologies/java/embedded/micro-edition/overview/index.html[+Oracle Java ME Embedded+] and link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javame/javacard/overview/getstarted/index.html[+Java Card platform+].
