:description: Setting Up an Oracle JET Application - Apache NetBeans
:keywords: Apache NetBeans, Tutorials, Setting Up an Oracle JET Application

This document provides a step-by-step set of instructions guiding you through the process of setting up an application based on link:http://oraclejet.org[+Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET)+]. JET empowers web and mobile developers by providing a modular toolkit based on modern JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5 design and development principles.


== Setting Up

In this exercise you learn how to set up an Oracle JET application via the  ``ojet-cli``  tool.

*Note:* If you have been using the Yeoman-based generator, that is,  ``generator-oraclejet`` , you must install it before continuing with the steps below, via  ``npm -g uninstall generator-oraclejet`` .

1. On the command prompt in a terminal window, type the following:


[source,java]
----

node -v
----

If the terminal window shows that Node is not installed or at a lower version than 5, link:https://nodejs.org/en/[+go to the Node site+] and install the Long Term Support (LTS) release of Node. Currently, at the time of writing, the LTS release is v6.11.2, and is listed as being "recommended for most users".

*Note:* Do not use the Latest release of Node, i.e., v8.x. The Node Package Manager (NPM) version 5 that comes with Node v8.x has bugs that cause nested dev-dependencies to not be installed properly. This is listed in our link:http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/globalSupport-releaseNotes.html[+Release Notes for JET 3.2.0+] and we are watching the npm bugs to see when they are going to fix them.


[start=2]
. After completing the above step, install the Oracle JET Command Line ( ``link:https://github.com/oracle/ojet-cli[+ojet-cli+]`` ) tool as follows:


[source,java]
----

npm -g install ojet-cli
----

*Note:* You may need to be in admin mode, such as via  ``sudo -s``  on Mac OS X, to be able to call the above command.

Under the covers, the  ``ojet-cli``  tool installs and uses popular JavaScript tools, such as Yeoman and Grunt, as can link:https://github.com/oracle/ojet-cli/blob/master/package.json[+be seen here+]. Where previously, you'd have to use commands such as  ``yo``  and  ``grunt`` , these are now hidden within the  ``ojet-cli``  tool and do not need to be installed separately anymore.


[start=3]
. The  ``-g``  argument in the previous step should have installed the  ``ojet``  command globally, so that you should be able to run  ``ojet``  anywhere, i.e., not in any specific folder or location since the  ``ojet``  command should now be globally available. To try it out, run the following:

[source,java]
----

ojet help
----

The terminal window should now show all the commands available to be used with  ``ojet`` . If not, you can manually configure the PATH of your system to include  ``ojet-cli`` .


[start=4]
. Once you have successfully run  ``ojet help`` , use  ``ojet``  to create a new Oracle JET application, as follows:


[source,java]
----

ojet create MyApp --template=navdrawer
----

'navdrawer', in the command line above, is one of the starter templates made available by Oracle JET, as outlined below:

* link:http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/globalExamples-Starter-Drawer.html[+Nav Drawer Starter+]
* link:http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/globalExamples-Starter-NavBar.html[+Nav Bar Starter+]
* link:http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/globalExamples-Starter-Basic.html[+Basic Starter+]

After the process completes, you should have an application structured as follows:

image::images/navdrawer.png[]

Open the application into an editor or IDE of your choice, such as NetBeans IDE, which displays the application as shown in the screenshot above.


[start=5]
. Once the application is created, use the terminal window to navigate into the root folder, i.e., the top folder, which is named  ``MyApp`` , and build and serve the application, as follows:


[source,java]
----

ojet serve
----

After the build completes, the browser opens and displays the application:

Congratulations, you have successfully set up an Oracle JET application. Repeat the steps above whenever you need to set up a new Oracle JET application.
