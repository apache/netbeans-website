:description: Interacting with RESTful Web Services in Oracle JET - Apache NetBeans
:keywords: Apache NetBeans, Tutorials, Interacting with RESTful Web Services in Oracle JET

This document provides a step-by-step set of instructions guiding you through the process of getting started with RESTful Web Services with the link:http://oraclejet.org[+Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET)+]. JET empowers web and mobile developers by providing a modular toolkit based on modern JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5 design and development principles.


== Setting Up an Oracle JET Application

In this exercise you set up an Oracle JET application and explore its default content.

1. Follow the steps described in xref:ojet-settingup.adoc[+Setting Up an Oracle JET Application+].


[start=2]
. Open the project into an editor or IDE of your choice, such as NetBeans IDE, which displays the application as follows:

image::images/navdrawer.png[]

Spend some time browsing through the application structure. In the next section, you'll be introduced to the main concepts of the application structure.


== Scenario 1: Standard jQuery

In this exercise, you use link:http://api.jquery.com/jquery.getjson/[+the standard $.getJSON construction from jQuery+] to access data via a publicly available RESTful web service.

1. In your Oracle JET module's JavaScript file, add the following:


[source,javascript]
----

self.data = ko.observableArray();
$.getJSON("http://movieapp-sitepointdemos.rhcloud.com/api/movies").
        then(function (movies) {
            $.each(movies, function () {
                self.data.push({
                    title: this.title,
                    director: this.director,
                    releaseYear: this.releaseYear,
                    genre: this.genre
                });
            });
        });
self.dataSource = new oj.ArrayTableDataSource(
        self.data, 
        {idAttribute: 'title'}
);
----

Read about link:http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/jet230/jet/reference-jet/oj.ArrayTableDataSource.html[+ArrayTableDataSource+] here.


[start=2]
. In the  ``define``  block, add a reference to  ``ojs/ojtable`` .


[start=3]
. In the matching HTML file, add the following:


[source,xml]
----

<table data-bind="ojComponent: {component: 'ojTable', 
        data: dataSource,
        columns: [
            {headerText: 'Director', field: 'director'},
            {headerText: 'Title', field: 'title'},
            {headerText: 'Genre', field: 'genre'},
            {headerText: 'Year', field: 'releaseYear'}
        ]
    }">
</table>
----

You should now see a table with data in your application:

image::images/ojtable.png[]


== Scenario 2: Oracle JET Common Model

In this exercise, you learn about the structure of link:http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/jetCookbook.html?component=home&demo=rootFramework_childCommonModel[+Oracle JET Common Model+].

1. The JET Common Model's oj.Model and oj.Collection allow applications to perform CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) via REST services. Before going further, read about link:http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/jetCookbook.html?component=crud&demo=table[+the Oracle JET Common Model here+]. Also read link:http://www.kennethlange.com/posts/oracle_jet.html[+Create a Web App with Oracle JET+].


[start=2]
. In the  ``js``  folder, that is, in the folder where  ``main.js``  is found, create a file named  ``MovieFactory.js``  and add the following to it:


[source,javascript]
----

define(['ojs/ojcore'], function (oj) {
    var MovieFactory = {
        resourceUrl: 'http://movieapp-sitepointdemos.rhcloud.com/api/movies',
        // Create a single movie instance:
        createMovieModel: function () {
            var Movie = oj.Model.extend({
                urlRoot: this.resourceUrl, 
                idAttribute: "_id"
            });
            return new Movie();
        },
        // Create a movie collection:
        createMovieCollection: function () {
            var Movies = oj.Collection.extend({
                url: this.resourceUrl, 
                model: this.createMovieModel()
            });
            return new Movies();
        }
    };
    return MovieFactory;
});
----

To understand the idea behind the code above, think of it is an implementation of link:https://www.martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/activeRecord.html[+Martin Fowler's "Active Record" pattern+], while its syntax is that of link:http://backbonejs.org/#Model[+Backbone.Model+] and link:http://backbonejs.org/#Collection[+Backbone.Collection+] in link:http://backbonejs.org/[+Backbone.js+]. For background reading on the Oracle JET Common Model, see the link:http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/jetCookbook.html?component=home&demo=rootFramework_childCommonModel[+Oracle JET Cookbook section on Common Model+] and the link:https://docs.oracle.com/middleware/jet112/jet/developer/GUID-808434E0-CA80-405C-9450-59E0BF525700.htm#JETDG334[+Using the Oracle JET Common Model and Collection Framework section in the Oracle JET Developer Guide+]. Best of all, take a look at the JsDoc for link:http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/jet112/jet/reference-jet/oj.Model.html[+oj.Model+] and oj.Collection.


[start=3]
. Replace the complete content of the JavaScript file in your Oracle JET module with the following:


[source,javascript]
----

define(['ojs/ojcore', 'knockout', 'MovieFactory', 
    'ojs/ojmodel', 'ojs/ojtable', 'ojs/ojcollectiontabledatasource'],
function (oj, ko, MovieFactory) {
    var viewModel = {
        movieCollection: MovieFactory.createMovieCollection(),
        dataSource: ko.observable(),
        // Called each time the view is shown to the user:
        initialize: function () {
            this.dataSource(new oj.CollectionTableDataSource(this.movieCollection));
            this.movieCollection.fetch();
        }
    };
    return viewModel;
});
----

[start=4]
. 
The HTML side of your Oracle JET module does not need to change. It is exactly the same as in the previous section.

You should now see a table with data in your application.

Congratulations! You have now learned how to get started with REST in your Oracle JET applications.
