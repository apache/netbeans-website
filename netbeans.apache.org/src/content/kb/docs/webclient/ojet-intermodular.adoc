:description: Strategies for Intermodular Communication in Oracle JET - Apache NetBeans
:keywords: Apache NetBeans, Tutorials, Strategies for Intermodular Communication in Oracle JET

This document provides a step-by-step set of instructions guiding you through the different approaches for communicating between modules defined by the link:http://oraclejet.org[+Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET)+]. JET empowers web and mobile developers by providing a modular toolkit based on modern JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5 design and development principles.


== Setting Up an Oracle JET Application

In this exercise you set up an Oracle JET application.

1. Follow the steps described in xref:ojet-settingup.adoc[+Setting Up an Oracle JET Application+].


[start=2]
. Open the project into an editor or IDE of your choice, such as NetBeans IDE, which displays the application as follows:

Spend some time browsing through the application structure before continuing.


== Global Variables

In this exercise, you learn about where and how to set global variables in an Oracle JET application.

1. Knockout.js has the concept of a "binding context", which are global objects that can be referenced throughout your application. Spend some time learning about link:http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-context.html[+the binding context here+].


[start=2]
. In any of your Oracle JET module's views, i.e., any of the HTML files that define the view of the Oracle JET modules, add the following:


[source,html]
----

<p>User Login Name: <input data-bind="textInput: *$root.userLogin*"></input></p>
----

Take note of the  ``$root``  binding context in the above.


[start=3]
. In the browser, notice there is already content in the input field. Make a change in the input field and notice that something in the menubar changes!


[start=4]
. Open the  ``appController.js``  file in the  ``src/js``  file. In that file, notice the following property has been defined:


[source,java]
----

self.userLogin = ko.observable("john.hancock@oracle.com");
----

[start=5]
. 
Create a new global variable, as follows:


[source,java]
----

self.stepArray = 
        ko.observableArray(
                [{label:'Step 1', id:'dashboard'},
                 {label:'Step 2', id:'customers'},
                 {label:'Step 3', id:'incidents'},
                 {label:'Step 4', id:'about'}]);
----

In the  ``index.html``  file, replace  ``ojNavigationList``  with  ``ojTrain`` , as follows:


[source,html]
----

<div id="train" 
       class="oj-train-stretch" 
       style="max-width:1500px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;"
       data-bind="ojComponent:{
         component: 'ojTrain', 
         selectedStep: router.stateId, 
         steps: stepArray}">
</div>
----

Make sure to include  ``ojs/ojtrain``  in the  ``require``  block in  ``main.js`` .

In the browser, notice that you have now replaced the navigation list with a train-based step component:

image::images/ojtrain.png[]


[start=6]
. Create your own global variable and refer to it in your Oracle JET application.

The  ``src/js/appController.js``  file is the central location in an Oracle JET application where global variables are defined and from which they can be accessed throughout the application.


== Unobtrusive Event Handling

If you need to get at a value that is being used in a different JavaScript file (not in the HTML file, as shown in the previous scenario above), you can take a look at the Knockout  ``dataFor``  and  ``contextFor``  methods.

1. Knockout.js has the concept of a "binding context", which are global objects that can be referenced throughout your application. Spend some time learning about link:http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/binding-context.html[+the binding context here+].


[source,java]
----

var rootViewModel = ko.dataFor(document.getElementById('globalBody'));
self.userLogin = rootViewModel.userLogin;
----

If you're wondering where the element ID  ``globalBody``  comes from, take a look in your  ``index.html``  file.


[start=2]
. Now, instead of needing to refer to the  ``$root``  binding context, you have a normal Knockout.js observable property that you can reference instead:


[source,html]
----

<p>Name: <span data-bind="text: *userLogin*"></span></p>
----

[start=3]
. 
Similarly, you can now get hold of the router and use it as follows:


[source,java]
----

var rootViewModel = ko.dataFor(document.getElementById('globalBody'));
rootViewModel.router.go('dashboard');
----

A different approach is to load the  ``appController.js``  via the  ``define``  block and use it after referencing it in the callback function.

Make the above changes in your application and check that everything still works.


== Publish/Subscribe with Knockout Postbox

In this exercise, you integrate and use link:https://github.com/rniemeyer/knockout-postbox[+knockout-postbox+] in your Oracle JET application.

1. In your  ``package.json``  file, include  ``knockout-postbox`` :

[source,java]
----

"knockout-postbox": "0.6.0"
----

[start=2]
. In your  ``scripts/grunt/config/oraclejet-build.js``  file, include  ``knockout-postbox``  in the  ``ojet build``  process:

[source,java]
----

copyCustomLibsToStaging: {
  fileList: [
   {
     cwd:'node_modules/knockout-postbox/build',
     src: ['*'],
     dest: 'web/js/libs/knockout-postbox'
   }
  ]
 },
----

[start=3]
. 
When you run  ``ojet-build`` , you should see  ``knockout-postbox``  in  ``web/js/libs`` .


[start=4]
. Include the library in  ``main.js`` , in the  ``requirejs.config section`` :


[source,java]
----

'knockout-postbox': 'libs/knockout-postbox/knockout-postbox'
----

[start=5]
. 
In the JavaScript files of the Oracle JET modules where you want to use it, include  ``'knockout-postbox'``  in the  ``define``  block. Or maybe consider whether it should be loaded in the  ``require``  block in the  ``main.js``  file.


[start=6]
. Now you can use  ``knockout-postbox`` , as described on its home page: link:https://github.com/rniemeyer/knockout-postbox[+https://github.com/rniemeyer/knockout-postbox+]. For example:
* *Publish.* In one of your Oracle JET modules, publish like this, in the  ``handleDetached``  lifecycle method:

[source,java]
----

self.name = ko.observable("John");

self.handleDetached = function(info) {
    ko.postbox.publish("currentUser", 
    {   
        'name': self.name()
    });
};
----

You could have an Oracle JET component, such as the following, for changing the value in the module:


[source,java]
----

Name: <input id="text-input" 
             type="text"
             data-bind="ojComponent: {component: 'ojInputText', value: name}"/>
----
* *Subscribe.* In one of your other Oracle JET modules, subscribe to the "currentUser" message published above, as follows:

[source,javascript]
----

self.name = ko.observable();

ko.postbox.subscribe("currentUser", function (newValue) {
    self.name(newValue.name);
});
----

Finally, render changes to the message as follows in the module where you subscription code is found:


[source,xml]
----

Name: <span data-bind="text: name"></span>
----

Congratulations! You have now learned different approaches for setting up communication between Oracle JET modules.
