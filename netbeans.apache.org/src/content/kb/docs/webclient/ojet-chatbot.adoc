:description: Chatbot Integration with Oracle JET - Apache NetBeans
:keywords: Apache NetBeans, Tutorials, Chatbot Integration with Oracle JET

This document provides a step-by-step set of instructions guiding you through the process of integrating link:https://www.oracle.com/solutions/mobile/bots.html[+IBCS chatbots+] with the link:http://oraclejet.org[+Oracle JavaScript Extension Toolkit (JET)+]. JET empowers web and mobile developers by providing a modular toolkit based on modern JavaScript, CSS3, and HTML5 design and development principles.


== Setting Up an Oracle JET Application

In this exercise you set up an Oracle JET application and explore its default content.

1. Follow the steps described in xref:ojet-settingup.adoc[+Setting Up an Oracle JET Application+].


[start=2]
. Open the project into an editor or IDE of your choice, such as NetBeans IDE, which displays the application as follows:

Spend some time browsing through the application structure. In the next section, you'll be introduced to the main concepts of the application structure.


== Setup your ChatBot to expose it via a Websocket

In this step, now configure the Intelligent Bot Webhook channel. Then try out the ChatBot from your Oracle JET application.

1. Return to the Intelligent Bot user interface in a new browser tab, select the *Settings* button on the left menu, then the *Channels* tab and finally click the *Add Channel* button.

[start=2]
. Follow the instructions from the Configuration section of:

*  ``http://<bot server>:3000/samples/chat``  if you’re using a Docker Image before 0.6 *OR*
*  ``http://<botserver>:8888/source/apps/chat/overview``  if you’re using a Docker image from 0.6


== Integrate the ChatBot in the Application

1. In the application, in the  ``src/js``  folder, create a folder named  ``jet-composites`` . Unzip the content of the ZIP file into it, in a folder named  ``bot-client`` :

image::images/t060001.png[]


[start=2]
. In  ``js/viewModels/Dashboard.js`` , add a reference to  ``jet-composites/bot-client/loader``  and  ``ojs/ojcomposite``  in the  ``define``  block, to load the  ``bot-client``  component.


[start=3]
. In  ``js/views/Dashboard.html`` , set the following properties, below  ``var self = this,`` :


[source,java]
----

self.websocketConnectionUrl = 'ws://' <bot websocket> => check with the instructor;
self.userId = 'your userId used to send message to the bot';
self.channel = 'channelId, copy from your webhook definition';
----

Can't get yours to work? Try  ``71DB044C-0624-4533-9C98-B8E76BAF919D``  as the channel ID.


[start=4]
. In  ``js/views/Dashboard.html`` , define the view as follows:


[source,xml]
----

<bot-client id="bot-client"
      channel="[[channel]]" 
      websocket-connection-url="[[websocketConnectionUrl]]" 
      user-id="[[userId]]">
</bot-client>
----

[start=5]
. 
Run the application and interact with the ChatBot.

You have now hooked your ChatBot into an Oracle JET application.


== Next Steps

Read link:http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/jetCookbook.html?component=composite&demo=basic[+the related Oracle JET Cookbook section+] in detail and include another CCA component from there.

Also read link:http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/jet320/jet/developer/GUID-18F9F429-1A80-4A9F-9B78-09428EFD2530.htm#BEGIN[+Creating Composite Components+] in the Oracle JET Developer Guide.

Congratulations! You have now learned how to create and load CCA components in your Oracle JET applications.
