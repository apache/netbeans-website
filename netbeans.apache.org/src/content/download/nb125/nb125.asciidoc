== Deployment Platforms

Apache NetBeans 12.5 runs on JDK LTS releases 8 and 11, as well as on JDK 16, i.e., the current JDK release at the time of this NetBeans release.

TIP: The current JDKs have an issue on macOS Big Sur, that causes freezes on dialogs. That could be fixed by applying the workaround described at link:https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/NETBEANS-5037?focusedCommentId=17234878&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-17234878[NETBEANS-5037] .

== Building from Source

To build Apache NetBeans 12.5 from source you need:

. A distribution of OpenJDK 8 or 11.
. Apache Ant 1.10 or greater (https://ant.apache.org).

Once you have everything installed then:

1. Unzip link:https://www.apache.org/dyn/closer.cgi/netbeans/netbeans/12.5/netbeans-12.5-source.zip[netbeans-12.5-source.zip]
in a directory of your liking.

[start=2]
. `cd` to that directory, and then run `ant` to build the Apache NetBeans IDE.
Once built you can run the IDE by typing `./nbbuild/netbeans/bin/netbeans`
