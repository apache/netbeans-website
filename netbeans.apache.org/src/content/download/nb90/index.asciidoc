== Apache NetBeans IDE (incubating) 9.0 

Apache NetBeans 9.0 is the first release of the Apache NetBeans IDE.

The main goals for this release are

- IP clearance of the Oracle code donation.
- Java 9 and 10 Support.

=== Downloads

- See link:/download/nb90/nb90-rc1.html[Apache NetBeans 9.0 RC1], released on may, 2018.
- See link:/download/nb90/nb90-beta.html[Apache NetBeans 9.0 Beta], released on february, 2018.

=== Features

////
To display a feature do as follows:

Add a header title, and an anonymous asciidoc block (--) with the ".feature" metadata, and write text inside the block:

== A title here
[.feature]
--
This is a feature
--

You can add images to the feature by adding a png file along with the document, and adding a image: construct to the text.

Use role="left" for left alignment or role="right" for right alignment.

Examples:

== An amazing feature
[.feature]
--
Here goes some text

image:nb90-module-info.png[Adding module-info.java, title="Adding module-info.java", role="left", link="nb90-module-info.png"]

And some more text

image:nb90-module-info-completion.png[Autocompletion in module-info.java, title="Autocompletion in module-info.java", role="right", link="nb90-module-info-completion.png"]

And even some more
--

Note: When rendered into HTML, the images will automatically be wrapped around 'colorbox', so that they're enlarged when clicked.

==== Supporting Local Variable Type Inference

Hints and refactorings for transforming to/from the new JDK 10 "var" type.

==== Supporting the Jigsaw Module System
[.feature]

image:nb90-module-info.png[Adding module-info.java, title="Adding module-info.java", role="left", link="nb90-module-info.png"]

NetBeans 9 supports link:http://openjdk.java.net/projects/jigsaw/spec/[JPMS (Jigsaw)]. 

Modulepath was added as a paradigm to NetBeans in addition to Classpath.

The standard NetBeans Java SE Project Type (Ant based) can be a single JDK 9 module simply by adding a `module-info.java` file into the default package.

Of course, we provide full autocompletion for `module-info.java`
--

==== A brand new Java Modular Application project type
[.feature]
--
image:nb90-new-multi-module.png[Java Modular Application, title="New Java Modular Application Project Type", role="left", link="nb90-new-multi-module.png"]

We have added a new *Java Modular project* type. This allows to develop
several JDK9 modules in one NetBeans project (Ant based). 

The advantage of this project type over several Java SE projects (each
containing one module) is that dependencies are simply managed by declaring
appropriate `exports` and `requires` in `module-info.java`, and all modules
in the project will be compiled at once.
--

==== Java Shell support
[.feature]
--
image:nb90-javashell.png[Java Shell Support, title="Java Shell Support", role="left", link="nb90-javashell.png"]

Java Shell is a new tool included in JDK9 defined in link:http://openjdk.java.net/jeps/222[JEP 222] to introduce REPL
(read-eval-print-loop) capabilities to Java. 

NetBeans provides integrated console-like UI for the Java Shell, leveraing NetBeans editor capabilites.

NetBeans can support the tool with the user project configuration, so the Java
Shell is set up to work with project classes and libraries, providing autocompletion out of the box in
the editor.
--

[.feature]
--
image:nb90-shell-agent.png[Shell Agent Configuration, title="JShell acess configuration", role="right", link="nb90-shell-agent.png"]

Also NetBeans greatly extends the capabilities of the commandline tool.
NetBeans can execute the shell *as an agent*, similar to a debugging agent, on the
debugged or run application (currently only J2SE applications are supported,
both Ant and Maven-based).
--

[.feature]
--
image:nb90-shell-save.png[Saving JShell snippets, title="Saving JShell snippets", role="left", link="nb90-shell-save.png"]

Snippets written in JShell can be redefined and tested, even against a running
code. 

When the prototype is ready, it can be saved to a regular Java source file
and integrated with the project.
