== Apache NetBeans Days

An "Apache NetBeans Day" is a class of event that happens regularly, with a clear definition of what makes an event be part of that class:

1. Have its opening keynote focus on the current state and roadmap of NetBeans. 
2. Have all demos done throughout the event in NetBeans.
3. Must be approved, via a lazy vote thread, on the Apache NetBeans dev mailing list.

*Note:* From an Apache point of view what's important (besides trademarks being respected) is that all organizations are treated fairly and that it's clear that they cannot "own" the event or project. We need to make sure we don't favor commercial entities or organizations over others is a strong requirement of the ASF's 501c(3) status, so we're very picky about that. And besides this legal requirement, it's what makes the ASF a unique place where companies which might compete in the market can collaborate in a fair way, due to our very neutral status.

For publicizing NetBeans events, the Apache News posts at https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/ can mention those events, best is to contact press@apache.org for that. Apache has an Event Listing (https://events.apache.org/), that we'd also like to make use of.
