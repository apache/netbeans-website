== Mailing lists

Mailing lists are the main way to get in touch with the NetBeans Community. Feel free to subscribe and participate. 

Lists are managed with link:https://untroubled.org/ezmlm/[ezmlm], refer to link:https://untroubled.org/ezmlm/manual/[ezmlm manual] for useful help commands.

The mailing lists can also be subscribed to in *digest form*, so that you at most receive one e-mail per day. *Digest form* email addresses are the same as
the email addresses below, substituting `subscribe@` with `digest-subscribe@` and substituting `unsubscribe@` with `digest-unsubscribe@`.


[[users]]
=== Users list

Use this list to ask questions about the usage of the NetBeans IDE, whether

This list is also useful as well for those using the NetBeans APIs to develop modules and applications.

Using prefix tags in the subject line, such as [ java ] or [ javascript ] is encouraged, to clearly distinguish the topic you're addressing in your e-mail.
