== How do I make a file template which actually creates more than one file?

For example, say you want to make a template which will appear in *File | New File* which will prompt the user for a name and location but then actually create several related files.

Just use an arbitrary empty file as the template, and declare it to have an `instantiatingWizardURL` attribute with an instance of `WizardDescriptor.InstantiatingIterator`. The wizard iterator can specify any sequence of Swing panels you like to ask the user whatever questions you like, and at the end it can do whatever you like to create the new files. Return the created files in `instantiate()`. 

Here is an link:http://hg.netbeans.org/main/file/tip/apisupport.project/src/org/netbeans/modules/apisupport/project/ui/wizard/librarydescriptor/[example of a wizard that creates a number of files].  This is the link:http://hg.netbeans.org/main/file/tip/apisupport.project/src/org/netbeans/modules/apisupport/project/ui/resources/layer.xml[layer file that declares it] (look at `emptyLibraryDescriptor`).

You may wish to reuse a standard GUI panel for picking a folder and name, as in 
`link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-netbeans-modules-projectuiapi/org/netbeans/spi/project/ui/templates/support/Templates.html#createSimpleTargetChooser(org.netbeans.api.project.Project,%20org.netbeans.api.project.SourceGroup[Templates.createSimpleTargetChooser]`.

The NetBeans 5.0 module development support has a (meta-)wizard *New Wizard*. Choose *New File* for *Registration Type* and follow the wizard steps.
