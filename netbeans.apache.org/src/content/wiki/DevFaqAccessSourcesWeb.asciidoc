=== How do I get access to zipped NetBeans sources for a periodic build?

(as of June, 2010)

1.  Go to the nightly build download site:

[source,java]
----

   link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/]
----

2.  Click the link for the build you want.

3.  You will be shown an index page where you can find a link to the folder with ZIP archives of binary builds and sources.

4.  Click the link or add "zip/" to the end of the URL in your browser's address bar manually and hit enter.  In other words, the complete URL might look like this:

[source,java]
----

   link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/2010-06-11_00-01-15/zip/[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/2010-06-11_00-01-15/zip/]
----

5.  There are about a dozen links on that page.  The one you want begins with "netbeans-trunk-nightly" and ends with "-src.zip"  Click
that link to download the source archive.
