== I need to add-to/remove-from/customize the content of my Node/DataObject/TopComponent's Lookup.  How do I do it?

If it's just adding something, use

[source,java]
----

return new ProxyLookup(
    new Lookup[] { 
      super.getLookup(), 
      Lookups.fixed(
            something, somethingElse) 
      });

----

If there's only one object, substitute `Lookups.singleton ( someObject )`.

If you need to change the content of the lookup on the fly, it's a little more complicated, but not too much.  Use the above
ProxyLookup technique if there's a Lookup returned by the superclass and you still want to use its content.
What you'll use to change content on the fly is the combination of `AbstractLookup` (which, as fate would
have it, is not actually abstract), and `InstanceContent`, which is a grab bag of stuff you can add to and
remove from.

The result will look something like this:

[source,java]
----

class MyNode extends AbstractNode {
  private final InstanceContent lookupContents;
  public MyNode() {
    this(new InstanceContent());
  }
  private MyNode(InstanceContent ic) {
    super(Children.LEAF, new AbstractLookup(ic));
    this.lookupContents = ic;
  }
}

----

When you need to change the contents of your lookup, you can call `InstanceContent.add()` or and `InstanceContent.remove()`, e.g.:

[source,java]
----

lookupContents.add(someObject);
lookupContents.remove(someObject);

----

Your lookup will be updated to include all items in the InstanceContent.

=== Custom Lookup Contents with DataObjects

DataObjects have a Lookup, but also use an older variant on the Lookup pattern, called a `link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/CookieSet.html[CookieSet]`.  Since this is a somewhat bewildering term, and `CookieSet` will eventually be deprecated, you may want to avoid using it.  A `CookieSet` ordinarily provides the `Lookup` for a DataObject;  and certain APIs such as `DataEditorSupport` require it.

However, it is possible to work with the more modern idioms of Lookup as described above, with a few caveats.  Such a DataObject typically looks like:

[source,java]
----

public class FooDataObject extends MultiDataObject {
  private final Lookup lookup;
  private final InstanceContent lookupContents = new InstanceContent();
  public FooDataObject(FileObject pf, MultiFileLoader loader) throws DataObjectExistsException, IOException {
    super(pf, loader);
    lookup = new ProxyLookup(getCookieSet().getLookup(), new AbstractLookup(lookupContents));
    lookupContents.add (...whatever...);
  }

  @Override
  public Lookup getLookup() {
    return lookup;
  }

  @Override
  protected Node createNodeDelegate() {
    return new DataNode (this, Children.LEAF, getLookup());
  }
 //...

----

You can then add and remove objects from your `InstanceContent` and the `DataObject` will behave as expected.  

*Caveat 1: You really must override `createNodeDelegate()`* or otherwise (in your `DataNode` subclass) pass your `DataObject`'s `Lookup` to your `DataNode`'s constructor.  Otherwise its lookup will be `getCookieSet().getLookup()` and nothing added to your `InstanceContent` will appear in the `Lookup` of your `Node`.  So, _if you use AbstractLookup in a DataObject, make sure its Node is really using your DataObject's Lookup_.

*Caveat 2: A DataObject should always appear in its own Lookup* &mdash; If you are _really sure_ that nothing is going to use your `DataObject`'s `CookieSet` at all, you can omit merging `getCookieSet().getLookup()` into the `ProxyLookup` in the constructor.  However, many things will not work correctly if _the DataObject itself_ cannot be found in its own `Lookup`.  If you are going to do that, replace `getCookieSet().getLookup()` with `Lookups.singleton(this)` to ensure it is present and cannot be removed or replaced.
