== How do I handle cut, copy and paste?

The subject of properly handling cut, copy and paste is underdocumented in modern material on the NetBeans Platform and I am not aware of any clear and concise examples that show how to handle all aspects of these common actions.  Anyone who can improve these shortcomings would be doing a great service for the NetBeans Platform developer community.

The link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/doc-files/api.html#edit[Nodes API documentation] provides some guidance, while chapter 14 of _NetBeans: The Definitive Guide_ link:http://www.netbeans.org/download/books/definitive-guide/html/apis-c_betterexplorer.html#N400551[goes into greater detail].  Although some parts of _NetBeans: The Definitive Guide_ are now outdated, the portions related to the Nodes API are likely still relevant.
