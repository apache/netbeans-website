=== How do I change the closing action of the MainWindow?

When you click the close button in the top right corner the application closes. If you want to do something before the application closes (e.g. show a dialog with OK and Cancel options) or prevent it from closing, this is possible.

Make a class in your module that extends `org.openide.modules.ModuleInstall`. There is a *Module Installer* template that will create this class for you.

Override the `closing` method and insert your special logic.
If you return `false` the application will not exit.
