== What is a FileObject?

FileObjects are _virtual files_ which live inside a xref:DevFaqFileSystem.adoc[FileSystem ].  They
may represent a file on disk - or anything else walks and talks like a file, or can be made to - such as a file
on a remote FTP server, a file entry in a JAR file, an entry in an XML file, etc.

FileObjects differ from `java.io.File` in certain ways:

* You don't generally ever have a FileObject representing a file that doesn't really exist (if you think a FileObject may have been deleted, check `isValid()`)
* You can listen for changes on FileObjects
* `FileObjects` can have key-value pairs of ad-hoc xref:DevFaqFileAttributes.adoc[attributes ] associated with them

They are part of the link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/doc-files/api.html[Filesystems API];
the javadoc for FileObject can be found link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html[here].
