== How can I change my node's appearance?

It's pretty simple to change the font color, style or weight for your node's label.  Simply override `getHtmlDisplayName` and provide some HTML in your return value. (An example can be found in xref:../tutorials/nbm-nodesapi2.adoc[this] tutorial.) Here is another example:

[source,java]
----

public class MovieNode extends AbstractNode {

    private Movie movie;

    public MovieNode(Movie key) {
        super(Children.LEAF, Lookups.fixed(new Object[]{key}));
        this.movie = key;
        setName(key.getTitle());
        setDisplayName(key.getTitle());
        getHandle();
        setIconBaseWithExtension("org/nb/marilyn/pics/marilyn.gif");
    }

    @Override
    public String getHtmlDisplayName() {
        return "*" + this.getDisplayName() + "*";
    }
    
}

----

The javadoc for the HtmlRenderer class link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-awt/org/openide/awt/HtmlRenderer.html[explains what subset of HTML is supported].  You can also change the icon's node by overriding various methods such as `getIcon(int type)` or `{getOpenedIcon()`}.

It's also possible, but far more difficult, to control other aspects of the node's appearance; for example, drawing a box around the node or changing its background color.  To do this you must create or modify the explorer view in which the node is rendered.  link:http://openide.netbeans.org/servlets/ReadMsg?list=dev&msgNo=31412[Fabrizio Giudici posted code that illustrates this] on the `dev@openide` list.
