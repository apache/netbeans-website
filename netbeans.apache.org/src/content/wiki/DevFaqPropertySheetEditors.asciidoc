=== How do I change the default behavior of PropertySheet editors?

*Issue:* How do I specify the kind of renderer which will represent the look of property value cell (in the same manner as it usually does for JTable)? For example, I want a string property not to be shown in grey if it's not editable.

*Solution:* If you specify a custom inplace editor it will also be used for rendering.

--

*Issue:* How can I provide a new kind of inplace editor? For example, I want to have a property which should be shown at Property Sheet like a combo-box or a spinner control.

*Solution:* See the docs for the link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-explorer/org/openide/explorer/propertysheet/InplaceEditor.html[InplaceEditor] interface.

--

*Issue:* How do I specify that a value is not editable in-place?

*Solution:* Provide a custom inplace editor that provides a disabled component for the inplace editor. Or mark it non-editable, but supply a custom editor that does edit it.

--

*Issue:* How do I specify that a property has a custom editor?

*Solution:* See the docs for the link:http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyEditor.html[PropertyEditor] interface.

--

*Issue:* How can I copy text from a non-editable property?

*Solution:* If the non-editable property has a Custom editor ('...' button) you can easily use Ctrl+c on content of a Custom editor. If the non-editable property doesn't have a Custom editor you can select property cell and press Ctrl+c, but whole line is copied (property name and value).

--

*Issue:* How do I access the Node the property belongs to?

*Solution:*

[source,java]
----

class MyEditor implements ExPropertyEditor {
  PropertyEnv env;

  public void attachEnv(e) {
    env = e;
  }

  public void anyMethod() {
     Object[] arr =  env.getBeans();
     // now arr contains either the real bean objects if invoked on Object
     // or it contains Node that the properties belong to
  }
}
