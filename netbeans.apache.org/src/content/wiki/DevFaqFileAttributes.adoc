== What are File Attributes?

xref:DevFaqFileObject.adoc[FileObjects] have _attributes_.  These are ad-hoc key-value
pairs which can be associated with a file and persist across shutdown and restart.

Attributes are routinely used in the xref:DevFaqModulesLayerFile.adoc[module XML files] which define the initial contents of the xref:DevFaqSystemFilesystem.adoc[system filesystem].  They are used to providing additional configuration data for files, such as declaring sorting order or the path to an icon file.

Attributes are perfectly safe to use freely in `layer.xml` files.

In pre-4.0 NetBeans, they were relatively commonly used for user files on disk.  They still may be used for user files, but this is now discouraged - the infrastructure has been changed to store all attributes in the xref:DevFaqUserDir.adoc[userdir] rather than sprinking `.nbattrs` files in directories all over the user's disk.  Since they are now stored in a central location, the more attributes there are, the longer it takes to find attributes for any given file.  Using attributes for user files _on disk_ has negative performance implications.

See `link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html#getAttribute(java.lang.String)[FileObject.getAttribute]` and
`link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html#setAttribute(java.lang.String,%20java.lang.Object)[FileObject.setAttribute]`.
