== Is there a standard way to provide user documentation for my module?

Yes. See the link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-netbeans-modules-javahelp/overview-summary.html[JavaHelp Integration API]
which describes how to include JavaHelp documentation in a module under *Help > Contents*;
and you can provide rich context help
rather easily, linking into the same documentation.

There is an IDE wizard for creating a help set for your module.

Applies to: NetBeans 5.x, 6.x
Platforms: all
