The simplest way is to run *File* > *New...* > *Module Development* > *Action* which creates an action for you and registers it in your `layer.xml`.

1. On the first tab, choose *Conditionally Enabled* action and select `DataObject` as the cookie class.
2. On the second tab, check *File Type Context Menu Item* and choose the MIME type and position.

You can use `text/html`, `text/x-java`, `text/x-ant+xml`, `text/x-jsp`, `image/png`, etc.
