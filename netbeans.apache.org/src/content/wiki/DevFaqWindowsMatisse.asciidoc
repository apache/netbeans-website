=== How do I use Matisse/GroupLayout (new form editor/layout manager in 5.0) in my window system components?

When you create a new window system component (link:DevFaqWindowsTopComponent.asciidoc[TopComponent]) using the template wizard in NB 5.0 or greater, the default layout manager is `GroupLayout` (the new, super-easy-to-design-with layout manager in NB 5.0). So you do not need to do anything special. Your module will have a declared dependency on the corresponding library module which is in the NB Platform as of 5.0.

`GroupLayout` is included in JDK 6; as long as JDK 5 needs to be supported (until JDK 8 is released at a minimum), NetBeans will use the library version rather than the JDK 6 version.

---

Applies to: NetBeans 5.0, 5.5, 6.x
