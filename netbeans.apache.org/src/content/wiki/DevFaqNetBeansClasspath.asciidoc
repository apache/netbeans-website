=== My module uses some libraries. I've tried setting CLASSPATH but it doesn't work. Help!

Setting `$CLASSPATH` or `%CLASSPATH%` on the command line will not affect anything -
NetBeans uses its own class loader system to find classes from modules.

What you need is for your libraries to _be_ a module; see link:DevFaqWrapperModules.asciidoc[DevFaqWrapperModules].

<hr/>

Applies to: NetBeans 6.8 and above
