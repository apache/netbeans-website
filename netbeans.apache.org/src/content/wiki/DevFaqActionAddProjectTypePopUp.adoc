== Generic approach

You can install an action into the context menu of _all_ projects simply by adding to your layer under the folder `Projects/Actions/`. Your action should be context-sensitive, meaning it should be a placeholder which implements `ContextAwareAction`; the context-aware derived action will do the real work. Generally it will look for an instance of `Project` in the supplied `Lookup` (context).

If you just override `isEnabled` on the derived action based on the context, the menu item will always be present, though it will be greyed out in the case of inappropriate projects. If you want to _hide_ the menu item for all but relevant projects, you need to set an additional flag (available starting in 6.9).

The following trivial action shows the location of a project so long as its name comes in the first half of the alphabet:

[source,java]
----

@ActionID(...)
@ActionRegistration(...)
@ActionReference(path="Projects/Actions")
public class DemoAction extends AbstractAction implements ContextAwareAction {
    public @Override void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {assert false;}
    public @Override Action createContextAwareInstance(Lookup context) {
        return new ContextAction(context);
    }
    private static final class ContextAction extends AbstractAction {
        private final Project p;
        public ContextAction(Lookup context) {
            p = context.lookup(Project.class);
            String name = ProjectUtils.getInformation(p).getDisplayName();
            // TODO state for which projects action should be enabled
            char c = name.charAt(0);
            setEnabled(c >= 'A' &amp;&amp; c <= 'M');
            putValue(DynamicMenuContent.HIDE_WHEN_DISABLED, true);
            // TODO menu item label with optional mnemonics
            putValue(NAME, "&amp;Info on " + name);
        }
        public @Override void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) {
            // TODO what to do when run
            String msg = "Project location: "
                    + FileUtil.getFileDisplayName(p.getProjectDirectory());
            DialogDisplayer.getDefault().notify(new NotifyDescriptor.Message(msg));
        }
    }
}

----

== Specific approach

Certain project types also read their context menu actions from type-specific folders.

For example 
<ul>
<li>Maven: `Projects/org-netbeans-modules-maven/Actions`</li>
</ul>

Applies to: NetBeans 7.0+
