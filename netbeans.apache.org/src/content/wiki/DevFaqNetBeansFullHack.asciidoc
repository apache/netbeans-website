== Can I test changes to the IDE without going through the license check and so on?

If you set the system property `netbeans.full.hack` to `true`,
the following IDE behaviors will be disabled
to make it quicker or more reliable to test other functionality:

* Auto Update background check (to see if updates are available); you can still use AU via *Tools > Plugin Manager*
* prompting about still-running tasks when shutting down
* license dialog
* import of old user directory
* IDE registration dialog
* dialog suggesting that you submit usage statistics
* welcome screen displayed by default and RSS feed refreshed
* blocking dialog when some modules could not be loaded
* use of `~/NetBeansProjects/` for newly created projects (`java.io.tmpdir` will be used instead)
* resizing gesture submit dialog (`SubmitStatus.resize`)
* weekly Maven repository indexing (can be configured in Options dialog)
* long package name for default group ID in new Maven project (`test` used instead)

This property is set by default when you:

* run the IDE from sources using `ant tryme`
* run the IDE from a netbeans.org module project using *Run Project* (`ant run`)
* run a functional test using `NbModuleSuite` or a unit test using `NbTestCase`

If you need to test one of the suppressed behaviors
(e.g. you are working on the license dialog),
just do not set this property.
For the `ant tryme` and `ant run` cases, add

[source,java]
----

tryme.args=
----

to `nbbuild/user.build.properties` or `~/.nbbuild.properties`.
