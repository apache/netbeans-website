== Branding Updater Splash

Contributed By; link:TonnyKohar.asciidoc[Tonny Kohar]


Adapted from: link:http://blogs.kiyut.com/tonny/2007/11/19/netbeans-platform-branding-updaterjar/[http://blogs.kiyut.com/tonny/2007/11/19/netbeans-platform-branding-updaterjar/]
<hr/>

Another series of Netbeans Platform branding, but this time is branding the updater.jar. Updater.jar is used by Netbeans Platform during modules updates and update tracking and work in conjunction with Auto Update Services.

After the branding of link:http://blogs.kiyut.com/tonny/2007/10/18/customize-netbeans-platform-splash-screen-and-about-dialog/[Splash Screen and About Dialog], you can also branding the updater splash image. This image will be shown by Netbeans Platform during module update and require a restart.

*note:* this is tested on Netbeans 6 RC1

=== Customize the Updater Splash Screen

In the project suite (under File, not project) expand the branding folder as show in the image.
If the folder branding/modules/ext/updater.jar does not exist, just create it, it is just a normal folder structure.

Note: updater.jar is not a jar file, it is a folder name

Add the following in the Bundle.properties

[source,java]
----

UpdaterFrame.TextBackground_R=0
UpdaterFrame.TextBackground_G=0
UpdaterFrame.TextBackground_B=0
 
UpdaterFrame.TextForeground_R=255
UpdaterFrame.TextForeground_G=255
UpdaterFrame.TextForeground_B=255
 
UpdaterFrame.Background_R=0
UpdaterFrame.Background_G=0
UpdaterFrame.Background_B=0
 
UpdaterFrame.outerColor_R=28
UpdaterFrame.outerColor_G=43
UpdaterFrame.outerColor_B=29
 
UpdaterFrame.centerColor_R=85
UpdaterFrame.centerColor_G=73
UpdaterFrame.centerColor_B=16
 
UpdaterFrame.isGradient=false
----

The above bundles properties values are example only, you may need to change it to reflects your own branding color scheme.

Then create any image file that you like to be a replacement for the default splash. In Netbeans 6 RC1, there is no size limit or constraints for the updater splash image, although I use the size of 400×191. However, it must be named *updatersplash.gif*
