== I want to show my own component(s) in the main window - where do I start?

Use File -> New File wizard, Module Development category and Window Component item. It will generate all necessary background code for you and open GUI Builder to design UI of your own component.

=== But what is behind the scenes, created by wizard?

* Subclass of xref:DevFaqWindowsTopComponent.adoc[TopComponent] is created. Design it just as you would a JPanel.
* Simple subclass of `javax.swing.AbstractAction` in created and xref:DevFaqActionAddMenuBar.adoc[added to main menu]. It's implemented it to open your component like follows:
[source,java]
----

public class MyAction extends AbstractAction {
   public MyAction() {
      putValue (Action.NAME, "Open My Component");
   }

   public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent ae) {
      new MyComponent().open();
   }
}
----

* Declarative XML descriptions of component are created following xref:DevFaqWindowsWstcrefAndFriends.adoc[declarative XML API] principles.

TopComponents are part of the link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/doc-files/api.html[Windows API].
