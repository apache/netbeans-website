== How can I customize the default project directory for my application, replacing "NetBeansProjects"?

You configure such things either in the launcher (netbeans.conf for the NB IDE, some other *.conf for a custom app), or at runtime in a ModuleInstall. 

[source,java]
----

File userDir = new File(System.getProperty("user.home"));
File myProjectsDir = new File(userDir, "My Projects");
if (!myProjectsDir.exists()) {
    myProjectsDir.mkdirs();
}
System.setProperty("netbeans.projects.dir", myProjectsDir.getAbsolutePath());
----
