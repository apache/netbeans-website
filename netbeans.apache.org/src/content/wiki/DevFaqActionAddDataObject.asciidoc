=== How do I add an action to my custom node type ?

Override the `public Actionlink:_.asciidoc[ ] getActions(boolean context)` method of your node (99% of the time you can ignore the boolean parameter).

If this node is really a `DataNode` for your own file type, instead see
link:DevFaqActionAddFileMime.asciidoc[DevFaqActionAddFileMime].
