== How can I add support for `Lookup`s on nodes representing my file type?

Any object you create can implement `Lookup.Provider`. The simplest way to create a mutable lookup is by using `InstanceContent` and `AbstractLookup`.  Simplified typical usage:

[source,java]
----

public SomeObject implements Lookup.Provider {
   private InstanceContent content = new InstanceContent();
   private final AbstractLookup lkp = new AbstractLookup(content);
   
   public someMethod() {
      ic.set (someCollection...);
   }

   public Lookup getLookup() {
      return lkp;
   }
}

----

This is how you create a lookup with dynamic content of your choosing.  See also Tom Wheeler's  link:http://www.tomwheeler.com/netbeans/[TodoListManager] for an example of some code that illustrates how to do this.

If you are using `link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/ProxyLookup.html[ProxyLookup]` to proxy another (or multiple) lookups, and you want to change the set of Lookups you are proxying on the fly, you will need to subclass `ProxyLookup` and call the protected method [link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/ProxyLookup.html#setLookups(org.openide.util.Lookup[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/ProxyLookup.html#setLookups(org.openide.util.Lookup]...) `setLookups(Lookup... lookups)`].
