First, make sure you have link:http://www.selenic.com/mercurial/[Mercurial] installed on your machine, along with its requirements such as Python.

Then, from the command line, you run

[source,java]
----

hg clone http://hg.netbeans.org/main/
cd main
----

to get the full Platform and IDE sources.  If you also want the `contrib/` modules:

[source,java]
----

hg clone http://hg.netbeans.org/main/contrib/
----

To build, simply run `ant`.
The build will appear in `nbbuild/netbeans/`.
