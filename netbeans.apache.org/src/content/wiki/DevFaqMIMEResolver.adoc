== How can I create declarative MIMEResolver and add new file type?

There is a wizard available for NetBeans modules which does this for you. Just run *New File | Module Development | File Type*. Fill in the *MIME Type* text field and choose whether to recognize file by extension or XML root element. If you want more sophisticated recognition, choose "*by Filename Extension*" and edit created resolver xml after you finish the wizard. In the next step type in "*Class Name Prefix*" your preferred prefix and finish the wizard.

Description of declarative MIME resolve can be found in link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/doc-files/HOWTO-MIME.html[this document]. In most cases it should be enough to resolve files only by their extensions as the wizard does (see link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/doc-files/resolverDocumentation.html#ext[ext element]). Other types of resolution can be more time expensive, so use them only exceptionally. Useful can be link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/doc-files/resolverDocumentation.html#name[file name matching], link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/doc-files/resolverDocumentation.html#pattern[file content matching] or link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/doc-files/resolverDocumentation.html#magic[magic matching] for binary files. Also consider existence of link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/doc-files/resolverDocumentation.html#exit[exit element] intended for negative matching which can skips next conditions.
