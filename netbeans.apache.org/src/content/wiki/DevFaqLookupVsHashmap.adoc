== Why use this strange convention - wouldn't a Map be good enough?

Other platforms do use string-keyed maps for this sort of thing, but there are some weaknesses with that approach:

1. it is impossible to enforce xref:DevFaqModuleDependencies.adoc[dependencies].  With `xref:DevFaqLookup.adoc[Lookup]`, a module's code cannot request an object of type X unless it can load/access the `X.class`. The module trying to look up an X will not be able to see `X.class` unless it xref:DevFaqModuleDependencies.adoc[declares a dependency] on the module that defines X _and_ the module which defines X says that it allows access to the Java package X lives in. (A `Map<Class<T>,T>` would do the same job as `Lookup`.)
2. The class of values in a map can change without notice - so if you have `(SomeIface) foo = (SomeIface) globalMap.get("foo")`, some new version of the module that provides "foo" can change the return type, causing `ClassCastException` s;  with `Lookup`, you cannot ever get an object that is not of the type you passed in the request - so Lookup's approach is more robust.
3. `Lookup` supports listening to changes in the result.
4. `Lookup` supports multiple instances for one key - if you call `lookup(X.class)` you get one instance.  If you call `lookupAll(X.class)` you get a `Collection<? extends X>` (so with `lookupAll()` it is more like a `Map<Class<T>,List<T>>`)

There are some other capabilities of `Lookup` (such as getting the specific type or number of results without actually creating objects, and providing named result items) but these are rarely used in practice.

`Lookup` is very powerful, yet simple and generic;  people quickly learn to love it, once they realize what it can do.
