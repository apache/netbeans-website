== How do I add native libraries to my module?

DLLs or SOs can be placed in the folder `release/modules/lib/` in a module project's sources (look in the *Files* tab). This will make them appear in the final NBM or application in a `lib` subdirectory beneath where the module's JAR resides. Then just use `System.loadLibrary` as usual.
