== What are `*.shadow` files?

`*.shadow` files are mainly used in the xref:DevFaqSystemFilesystem.adoc[system filesystem]
for configuration data.
They are the functional equivalent of Unix symbolic links -
a `*.shadow` file is a pointer to another file whose
behavior in every respect except its path and file name is the same as the original.

`*.shadow` files are commonly used where only a single instance of an object is needed,
but it must be registered in multiple folders.
For example, a general `Action` is declared in the `Actions/` folder of the
system filesystem.
But the action also needs to appear in menus and toolbars, possibly other places.
So, rather than create multiple instances of an action, one [[DevFaqInstanceDataObject|`*.instance` file]]
is created in the xref:DevFaqModulesLayerFile.adoc[module's layer file], in the `Actions/` folder.
Then `*.shadow` files are created in all of the other places the `*.instance` file would be needed,
pointing to the original file.

Declaring a .shadow file in the system filesystem looks like this:

[source,xml]
----

<folder name="A">
  <file name="com-foo-mymodule-MyClass.instance"/>
</folder>
<folder name="B">
  <file name="Shadow1.shadow">
    <attr name="originalFile" stringvalue="A/com-foo-mymodule- MyClass.instance"/>
  </file>
</folder>
<folder name="C">
  <file name="anotherShadow.shadow">
    <attr name="originalFile" stringvalue="A/com-foo-mymodule-MyClass.instance"/>
  </file>
</folder>
----

Shadow files can also point to real files on disk.
For example, the Favorites tab in the NetBeans IDE
uses shadow files to link to real directories on disk.

=== Creating Shadow Files Programmatically

If you need to create `.shadow` files programmatically, use [link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-loaders/org/openide/loaders/DataShadow.html#create(org.openide.loaders.DataFolder,%20java.lang.String,%20org.openide.loaders.DataObject[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-loaders/org/openide/loaders/DataShadow.html#create(org.openide.loaders.DataFolder,%20java.lang.String,%20org.openide.loaders.DataObject]) `DataShadow.create()`] &mdash; do not write `FileObject`s and try to set attributes on them.  In an XML layer, a `DataShadow`'s original file is pointed to by a file attribute.  On disk, that is accomplished via the _file's content_ instead.  To reliably create `DataShadow`s, let the infrastructure do it for you - do not make assumptions about how the original file is pointed to.
