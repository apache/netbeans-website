(as of June, 2010)

1.  Go to the nightly build download site:

[source,java,subs="macros"]
----

   link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/]
----


[start=2]
.  Click the link for the build you want.


[start=3]
.  You will be shown an index page where you can find a link to the folder with ZIP archives of binary builds and sources.


[start=4]
.  Click the link or add "zip/" to the end of the URL in your browser's address bar manually and hit enter.  In other words, the complete URL might look like this:

[source,java,subs="macros"]
----

   link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/2010-06-11_00-01-15/zip/[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/2010-06-11_00-01-15/zip/]
----


[start=5]
.  There are about a dozen links on that page.  The one you want begins with "netbeans-trunk-nightly" and ends with "-src.zip"  Click
that link to download the source archive.
