=== Can I add a menu item to the context menu of every Java source file?

Yes. In NetBeans 5.0 and later there is a wizard available for NetBeans modules which does this for you. Just run *New File | Module Development | Action*, as an action type choose *Conditionally Enabled*. Choose "*Data Object*" in Cookie Class(es) combobox. On the next step select "*File Type Context Menu Item*" and choose `text/x-java` in the *File Type Context Menu Item* combobox, finish the wizard and you are done. For more information you may press the *Help* button available at the bottom of each step of the wizard.
