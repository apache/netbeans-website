=== I want my action to appear between to existing items/in a specific place in the menu. Can I do that?

Yes.  Use link:DevFaqOrderAttributes.asciidoc[ordering attributes] in the link:DevFaqModulesLayerFile.asciidoc[layer file] for your module.

If you are using the IDE's module project, the new *Action* template will let you specify a location for the action in the wizard and generate the right attribute for you.
