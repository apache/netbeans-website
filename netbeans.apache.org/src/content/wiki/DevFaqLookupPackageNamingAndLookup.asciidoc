== After adding my class to Lookup I get a "ClassNotFoundException" when trying to look it up, why?

Q: After adding my class to lookup I get a `ClassNotFoundException` when trying to look it up, why?

A: You might have tried to place the interface and the implementation class in different modules but used the same package name. NetBeans prohibits two or more modules to define classes in the same package. Choose a distinctive package name (or package name prefix) for each module.
