=== Can I add syntax coloring for my own data object/MIME type?

Yes, but it is not trivial. There is a tutorial on the subject: link:http://wiki.netbeans.org/How_to_create_support_for_a_new_language[http://wiki.netbeans.org/How_to_create_support_for_a_new_language]

<hr/>

Applies to: NetBeans 6.7 and later, but most concepts (not the exact APIs) have been available since 6.0
