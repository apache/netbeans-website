=== Can I add new panels to the Options window?

Use the link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-netbeans-modules-options-api/overview-summary.html[Options Dialog and SPI] as explained in the link:http://platform.netbeans.org/tutorials/nbm-options.html[NetBeans Options Window Module Tutorial].

There are wizards for creating primary and secondary options panels. Use `New File.../Module Development/Options Panel` and follow the wizard.
