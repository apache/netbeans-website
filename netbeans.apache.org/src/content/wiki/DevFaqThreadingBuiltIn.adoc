== What APIs come with built-in background thread handling

A few APIs come with built in multi-threading - if you want your code to run on a background thread, you don't have to do any special set up to do that.

Specifically they are

* The Actions API - if you override `asynchronous` to return true (or don't override it - for historical reasons this is the default), your action's `performAction` method will run in the background
* The Nodes API - to compute node children that are expensive to create, use `link:http://wiki.netbeans.org/DevFaqNodesChildFactory[ChildFactory]` and specify `true` as the boolean argument to `link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/nodes/Children.html#create(org.openide.nodes.ChildFactory,%20boolean)[Children.create()]`
* Various parsing APIs - for syntax highlighting languages and so forth - usually you just provide a task to do, and it will automatically call you in the background when a reparse is being done
* QuickSearch API - searchers are typically called in background thread by infrastructure in  link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-netbeans-spi-quicksearch/org/netbeans/spi/quicksearch/SearchProvider.html#evaluate%28org.netbeans.spi.quicksearch.SearchRequest,%20org.netbeans.spi.quicksearch.SearchResponse%29[SearchProvider.evaluate(...)]
