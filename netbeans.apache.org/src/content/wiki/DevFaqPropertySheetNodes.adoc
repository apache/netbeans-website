== How do I show my node's properties in the Properties view?

I want to have the properties of my custom nodes displayed in the Properties view when they are selected in my tree view. How do I go about doing that?

Listen for changes in the selected nodes in the [link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-explorer/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerManager.html[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-explorer/org/openide/explorer/ExplorerManager.html] `ExplorerManager`], and set the `activatedNodes` property on the parent [[DevFaqWindowsTopComponent| `TopComponent`]] which contains your tree view:

[source,java]
----

public class MyComponent extends TopComponent implements PropertyChangeListener {
    private ExplorerManager explorerManager;
----
[source,java]
----

    public MyComponent() {
        explorerManager = new ExplorerManager();
        explorerManager.addPropertyChangeListener(this);
    }
----
[source,java]
----

    public void propertyChange(PropertyChangeEvent evt) {
        if (evt.getSource() == explorerManager &&
                ExplorerManager.PROP_SELECTED_NODES.equals(evt.getPropertyName())) {
           setActivatedNodes(explorerManager.getSelectedNodes());
        }
    }
}
----

Note that the example above is not a complete `TopComponent` implementation with a tree view and nodes. It is simply demonstrating how to have the selected node's properties shown in the Properties view.
