== What are .settings files?

`.settings` files are similar to [[DevFaqInstanceDataObject| `.instance` files]],
with the difference that they are XML format, and can contain serialized data rather than just default instances.

Since the introduction of [link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/NbPreferences.html[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/NbPreferences.html] `NbPreferences`] to replace [link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-options/org/openide/options/SystemOption.html[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-options/org/openide/options/SystemOption.html] `SystemOption`],
very little new code uses these files, and they should be considered semi-deprecated.  They are difficult and error-prone to use, and have a fair amount of overhead.  The Window System still requires them to be used to persist the state of opened windows/tabs (caret position, what file is opened, or other state that should be restored when reopening a [link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/TopComponent.html] `TopComponent`] after a restart) across application runs.

A `.settings` file can encode the entire parent class and interface hierarchy of the object it represents, so that a query about _whether an object of a given type is present_ (such as using `link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/Lookups.html#forPath(java.lang.String)[Lookups.forPath](&quot;path/to/folder&quot;).allItems()`) can be answered without actually creating an instance of the object.  

Settings files are also useful if you are declaring some objects in a layer file (see xref:DevFaqModulesLayerFile.adoc[DevFaqModulesLayerFile]) _and intend to write them back out to disk after they have been modified in-memory_ (note this involves writing ugly and inefficient hexadecimal-encoded serialized data into XML files - if the object is a singleton, using `link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/NbPreferences.html[NbPreferences]` will be both more efficient and more readable).

=== Example

[source,xml,subs="verbatim,macros"]
