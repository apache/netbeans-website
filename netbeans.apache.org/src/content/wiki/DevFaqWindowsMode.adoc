== What is a Mode in the Windowing System?

"Mode" refers to "docking mode".  A Mode is a place in a main window, a place between splitters. Separate "floating" window is also backed by Mode. Mode is usually visually represented by a tabbed container.  Programmatically it is represented by the class `org.openide.windows.Mode`

Think of a `Mode` as synonymous with a one of the tabbed containers you see in the IDE's main window.  The name "Mode" is historical, and a bit unfortunate.  When you hear "Mode," think tabbed container and you'll be fine.

*A Mode is _not_ a GUI component*.  There is no legitimate programmatic way to fetch the component that represents a Mode on-screen, and the windowing system makes no guarantees about what that component is.

Modes can contain one or more xref:DevFaqWindowsTopComponent.adoc[TopComponent]s.  They may be visible or non-visible at any given time.

The xref:DevFaqCustomWindowMode.adoc[DevFaqCustomWindowMode] page has a visual representation of the available modes, and link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/doc-files/api.html[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-windows/org/openide/windows/doc-files/api.html] has details about the contents of wstcref and settings files.

=== Pre-Defined Modes

NetBeans defines six modes in core.ui:

* topSlidingSide
* rightSlidingSide
* leftSlidingSide
* bottomSlidingSide
* explorer
* properties

NetBeans defines additional modes in other places:

* commonpalette
* output
* navigator
* editor
* CssPreviewTCWsmode

=== Docking a TopComponent into a Mode

To dock a TopComponent into the 'editor' mode:

[source,java]
----

Mode myMode = WindowManager.getDefault().findMode("editor");
TopComponent myTopComponent = WindowManager.getDefault().findTopComponent("MyTopComponent");
myMode.dockInto(myTopComponent);
----

''The ID string of the TopComponent can usually be found in that TopComponent's Java file where it gets registered using annotations, or in the layer.xml.
''
