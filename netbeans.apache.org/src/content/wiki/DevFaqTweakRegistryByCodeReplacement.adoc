The *New Action* wizard allows you to uncheck both menu and toolbar placement for your action and only assign a keyboard shortcut. To learn how to do this manually, read on.
Refer to xref:TaT_HackingNetBeansXMLLayerPartOne.adoc[TaT_HackingNetBeansXMLLayerPartOne] for more details.

== Trick #1

* Retain the action's basic registration:
[source,xml]
----

<folder name="Actions">
    <folder name="Tools">        
        <file name="org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.instance"/>
    </folder>
</folder>

----

* This registers an action as a *Global Menu Item*:
[source,xml]
----

<folder name="Menu">
    <folder name="Tools">
        <file name="org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.shadow">
            <attr name="originalFile"
                  stringvalue="Actions/Tools/org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.instance"/>
            <attr name="position" intvalue="150"/>
        </file>
    </folder>
</folder>

----

* This registers an action as a *Global Toolbar Button*:
[source,xml]
----

<folder name="Toolbars">
    <folder name="Build">
        <file name="org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.shadow">
            <attr name="originalFile"
                  stringvalue="Actions/Tools/org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.instance"/>
            <attr name="position" intvalue="325"/>
        </file>
    </folder>
</folder>

----

* To assign a shortcut key, replace either or both of them with something like the following:
[source,xml]
----

<folder name="Shortcuts">
    <file name="O-F3.shadow">
        <attr name="originalFile"
              stringvalue="Actions/Tools/org-nvarun-tat-SayCheez.instance"/>
    </file>
</folder>

----

=== Trick #2

* In the above example the action has the shortcut key *Alt+F3*, which is represented as `O-F3`. In general, if you have some key combination that uses *Alt* (or the equivalent on Mac OS X), then use `O`. Separate modifiers from the base keycode name with `-`, and append `.shadow` for the filename. *Ctrl* (or its Mac equivalent) is represented by `D`, and *Shift*by `S`. (`C` and `A` represent the literal *Ctrl* and *Alt* keys, but this is less portable.)

== Tips to Remember

1. Following are some keycode equivalents. See Javadoc for `KeyEvent` for the full list:
* *A* to *Z* (as is), *F1* to *F12* (as is), *0* to *9* (as is)
* */* as `SLASH`, *\* as `BACK_SLASH`
* *;* as `SEMI_COLON`
* *.* as `PERIOD`
* *â€˜* as `QUOTE`
