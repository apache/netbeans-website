== How to change selected tab of Multiview?

Using `org.netbeans.core.api.multiview.MultiViews` you can get an instance of `org.netbeans.core.api.multiview.MultiViewHandler`.

For example: Get the handler for the current TopComponent

[source,java]
----

TopComponent activated = WindowManager.getDefault().getRegistry().getActivated();
MultiViewHandler mvh = MultiViews.findMultiViewHandler(activated);
----

Using this handler you can call 

* `getPerspectives()` to get all available tabs
* `requestActive/requestVisible(MultiViewPerspective desc)` to activate the tab
