== When should I use a WeakListener

You should use a xref:DevFaqWeakListener.adoc[WeakListener] any time you are adding a listener to an object, but there is no code - and possibly no opportunity - to explicitly remove it.

If the thing you are listening to does have some kind of observable life-cycle, it is preferable to explicitly add and detach listeners.

But in the case that you are adding a listener which is never explicitly removed, it is good form to use `link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/WeakListeners.html[WeakListeners]`
