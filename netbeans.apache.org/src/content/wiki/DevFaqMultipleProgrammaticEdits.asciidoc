=== I want to make some programmatic changes to the edited file. How can I do it so one Undo undoes it all?

Create a `Runnable` that will do all of the code generation/munging you want to do.  Pass it to `org.openide.text.NbDocument.runAtomic(doc, runnable)`.

Example:

[source,java]
----

...
import org.openide.text.NbDocument;
import org.netbeans.api.editor.EditorRegistry;
...

public final class MyAction
    implements ActionListener
{
    private class RunnableAction
        implements Runnable
    {
        private JTextComponent ed;
        private Document doc;

        private RunnableAction( JTextComponent ed, Document doc )
        {
            this.ed = ed;
            this.doc = doc;
        }

        @Override
        public void run()
        {
            ...
        }
    }

    public void actionPerformed( ActionEvent e )
    {
        JTextComponent ed = EditorRegistry.lastFocusedComponent();
        StyledDocument doc = ( StyledDocument ) ed.getDocument();

        // Perform all of the changes atomically so that they can be undone with one undo.
        NbDocument.runAtomic( doc, new RunnableAction( ed, doc ) );
    }
}
----
