=== Where can I find Javadoc for the IDE and Platform?

There is no separate set of Javadoc for the NetBeans Platform.  However, as the Platform is just a subset of the IDE, the Javadoc for the IDE will apply.

You can link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/index.html[browse the Javadoc online] (this link always points to the latest development version).

You can also download the Javadoc for a particular NetBeans release:

1.  Go to the nightly build download site: link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/]

2.  Click the link for the build you want.

3.  Add "zip/" to the end of the URL in your browser's address bar and hit enter. In other words, the complete URL might look like this: link:http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/2010-06-11_00-01-15/zip/[http://bits.netbeans.org/dev/nightly/2010-06-11_00-01-15/zip/]

5.  There are about a dozen links on that page. The one you want begins with `netbeans-trunk-nightly` and ends with `-javadoc.zip`; click that link to download the Javadoc archive.

Finally, you can go to the update center (*Tools > Plugin Manager*) in the NetBeans IDE and request the *NetBeans API Documentation* module, which bundles Javadoc matching your IDE release. Use *Help > Javadoc References* (*View > Documentation Indices* in NetBeans 5.x) to see the overview pages for API sets currently used by your open projects. The IDE should also automatically display this Javadoc in code completion popups.

Applies to: NetBeans 5.x, 6.x, 7.x
