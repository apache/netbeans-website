[[Demo_Script]]
== Demo Script

Prerequisites:

1. NetBeans 6.0 (tested against 20070419 ~ M9)
. JDK 6.0u1
. Any supported OS (tested on Ubuntu)

Preparation:

1. Create a Java application.
. Add to the main method:

[source,java]
----
  System.out.println("First main class.");
----

. Add a new Java main class. Add to its main method:

[source,java]
----
System.out.println("Second main class.");
----

. Click *Run* (F6). You should see

[source,bash]
----
run:
First main class.
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

Demo steps:

1. From the *<default>* combo in the toolbar, select *Customize...*.
. Click *New...* (configuration).
. Enter name `second` and click *OK*.
. Click *Browse...* (for main class).
. Pick the second class and click *Select Main Class*.
. Click *OK* to close the *Properties* dialog.
. Click *Run*; you should see

[source,bash]
----
run:
Second main class.
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

1. Choose *<default>* again in the combo and click *Run*; you should see the first main class again.
. Right-click the project and choose *Properties*.
. Under *Run*, switch to *second* configuration.
. Add `-showversion` to *VM Options*. Note that the field's label becomes boldfaced.
. Click *OK* and *Run*; you should see

[source]
----
run:
java version "1.6.0_01"
JavaTM SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_01-b06)
Java HotSpotTM Server VM (build 1.6.0_01-b06, mixed mode)

Second main class.
BUILD SUCCESSFUL
----

== Optional material

Question: Can I control other things besides *Run* options?

Answer: You can, though for at least for 6.0 this is not supported through the GUI. For example, go to the *Files* tab and open `nbproject/configs/second.properties`. Add:

[source,bash]
----
build.compiler=extJavac
javac.compilerargs=-J-showversion
----

With the configuration set to *second*, press *Clean and Build Main Project* (S-F11). You should see

[source,bash]
----
Compiling 2 source files to /tmp/JavaApplication1/build/classes
java version "1.6.0_01"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_01-b06)
Java HotSpot(TM) Client VM (build 1.6.0_01-b06, mixed mode, sharing)

compile:
----

Generally, anything normally set in `project.properties` can be overridden on a
per-configuration basis. The *Properties* dialog outside the *Run* panel will
only show the contents of `project.properties`, however.
