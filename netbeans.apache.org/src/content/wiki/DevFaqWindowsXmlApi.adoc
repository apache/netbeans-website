== How does the declarative XML API for the window system work?

The API is not hard, just a bit baroque.

On startup, the window system needs to know some things to
construct the main window, and possibly restore the state it was in before shutdown:

* The window system needs know what components it will be displaying
* It needs to know where to display individual components
* And it has a way to define places where components can be displayed, and needs to know what places have been defined

It would be a disaster for performance if all possible components in the system had
to be instantiated/deserialized during startup just to figure out if they actually
need to be on screen.  The XML definitions for window system components allow
a module to completely declaratively provide all the information described above.

There are three main file types to be concerned with - these are put in the xref:DevFaqSystemFilesystem.adoc[System Filesystem ]
by declaring them in your module's xref:DevFaqModulesLayerFile.adoc[layer file]:

* *`xref:DevFaqDotSettingsFiles.adoc[.settings files]`* - representing xref:DevFaqWindowsTopComponent.adoc[TopComponent]s that will be on screen - these go in `Windows2/Components`
* *`xref:DevFaqWindowsMode.adoc[.wsmode files]`* - representing xref:DevFaqWindowsMode.adoc[docking modes] - places where TopComponents can be put - think of them as tabbed containers - these go in `Windows2/Modes`.  For each Mode, you will also create a folder in `Windows2/Modes` where the `.wstcref` files that indicate what components are present can go TopComponents can live (essentially tabbed containers)
* *`xref:DevFaqWindowsWstcrefAndFriends.adoc[.wstcrf files]`* - a pseudo symbolic-link that contains some configuration data and points to the appropriate .settings file via its ID - put these in the folder you created in `Windows2/Modes`
