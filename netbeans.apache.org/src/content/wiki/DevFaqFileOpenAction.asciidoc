=== How do I get the Open File item on the File menu into my platform application?

The Open File menu item is a part of the *User Utilities* module, in the `ide` cluster.
This module can be added to your project using the *Libraries* page of the module property sheet. It must be also added to the suite (your suite > Project properties, Libraries > ide > User Utilities)

The *User Utilities* module also adds the *Find in Files* feature and support for PDF files (they are recognized and can be opened by double-clicking on them).
