== What is the user directory, what is in it, and why do I need one?

The userdir is a directory passed to NetBeans on startup by the launch script.
You can specify it on the command line, e.g.:

[source,java]
----

--userdir /tmp/some/folder/that/need/not/exist/yet
----

It contains configuration data that allows NetBeans to restore its state after shutdown;
it also contains log files and other miscellaneous artifacts of running NetBeans.
The `config/` subfolder of the userdir
is where changes made at runtime to the system filesystem (xref:DevFaqSystemFilesystem.adoc[DevFaqSystemFilesystem])
are written.

Some new modules installed by Plugin Manager will also be installed here, as if it were a "cluster" directory (such as `platform` or similar in a NetBeans IDE or Platform installation). NBMs which specify a particular cluster name will not be placed in the user directory, however.

It is expected that applications built on the NetBeans platform
will provide a custom launch script which will specify the userdir
such that it does not overlap with any other platform-based application.
This is done for you if you use the stock launchers created by "suite" projects in the IDE.

Only one running copy of NetBeans may use a single userdir at a time;
during startup, the platform checks a lock file and if it is present,
tries to contact the running instance via a socket,
to determine if the lock file is stale or not.
If it does not make contact, it will display a warning
and ask the user if startup should continue.
This same protocol also supports link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-netbeans-modules-sendopts/overview-summary.html[command-line options].

You can find the path to the userdir at runtime if you need to,
using the system property `netbeans.user`.
Most modules should not do this;
use `Places.getUserDirectory` to find the userdir or use `FileUtil.getConfigFile`
to work with the `config/` subdirectory.


Applies to: NetBeans 6.7 and later
