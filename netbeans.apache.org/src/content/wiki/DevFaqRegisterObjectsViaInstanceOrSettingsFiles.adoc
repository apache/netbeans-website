== Should I register an object in my layer file using .instance or .settings files? What about .shadow files or serialization?

There are a number of kinds of files which are treated (and can be transformed into) instances of objects.

|===
|What |When to Use It |How 

|`.instance` files |Almost all the time |Create a file whose name is the fully qualified name of the class you want to register, with the . characters replaced with - characters and the extension `.instance` - e.g. `<file name=&quot;com-foo-mymodule-MyStatusBarElementProvider.instance&quot;/>`.  You can also give the file a different name and instead declare the type using a xref:DevFaqFileAttributes.adoc[FileObject attribute], e.g. <blockquote>`<file name=&quot;x.instance&quot;>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<attr name=&quot;instanceClass&quot; stringvalue=&quot;com.foo.mymodule.MyStatusBarElementProvider&quot;/>
</file> `</blockquote>
[source,xml]
----

 If you want to use a factory method and set up some configuration of the object using your own xref:DevFaqFileAttributes.adoc[FileObject attributes], you can instead <ul><li>Create a public static method on some class, which takes a `link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileObject.html[FileObject]` as an argument, e.g.<blockquote>`<file name=&quot;x.instance&quot;>&nbsp;&nbsp;<attr name=&quot;instanceClass&quot; stringvalue=&quot;com.foo.mymodule.MyStatusBarElementProvider&quot;/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<attr name=&quot;instanceCreate&quot; methodvalue=&quot;com.foo.mymodule.MyStatusBarElementProvider.factoryMethod&quot;/>&nbsp;&nbsp;attr name=&quot;yourCustomAttribute&quot; stringvalue=&quot;someValueYouCareAbout&quot;/></file>`</blockquote>
----
 

|`.settings` files |In specialized situations when the object may be saved back to disk with changed state at runtime and you cannot simply use `NbPreferences` |Create an XML file in your module for your settings file, populated as described in xref:DevFaqDotSettingsFiles.adoc[the .settings file FAQ].  Register that file in some folder by specifying the XML file as the URL of the `<file>` entry in your layer, e.g. `<file name=&quot;MyObject.settings&quot; url=&quot;theActualFile.xml&quot;/>` (in this case, the layer.xml file and the settings file are in the same Java package in your sources). 

|`.shadow` files |If you want your object to be a pseudo-singleton, but it will be registered in multiple folders, or the user may delete the shadow file and you need to provide a way for the user to recover it (i.e. a way to create a new `.shadow` file) |`xref:DevFaqDotShadowFiles.adoc[.shadow]` files are like unix symbolic links - they point to another file somewhere else in the xref:DevFaqSystemFilesystem.adoc[system filesystem] or on disk, and behave as if they were really that file.  Use one of the other registration mechanisms described here to register your object in some folder.  Then create a shadow file as xref:DevFaqDotShadowFiles.adoc[described here] which points to it.
 An example of this is Menu and Toolbar actions &mdash; all actions are registered in subfolders of the `Actions/` folder in the system filesystem.  The user might manually delete or rearrange them;  the UI that allows this can also show all available actions, so that the user can replace accidentally deleted actions. 

|`.ser` (serialized object) files |Basically never |Write a serialized object out to disk in a file with the extension `.ser`, either on the fly at runtime into some folder under `link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-filesystems/org/openide/filesystems/FileUtil.html#getConfigFile(java.lang.String)[FileUtil.getConfigFile()]`, or serialize an object ahead of time somehow, copy it into your module sources, and register something like `<file name="foo.ser" url="relative/path/in/module/sources/from/layer/dot/xml/to/foo.ser"/>`.  Remember that if you use serialization, _any_ change to the class you serialized is likely to break loading of existing `.ser` files - this is almost never a good idea. 

|Your own file type |Basically never |Any xref:DevFaqDataObject.adoc[DataObject] type which contains an `link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/cookies/InstanceCookie.html[InstanceCookie]` (and ideally also an `link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-nodes/org/openide/cookies/InstanceCookie.Of.html[InstanceCookie.Of]`) can be registered in some folder. If this is done ` link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util-lookup/org/openide/util/lookup/Lookups.html#forPath(java.lang.String)[Lookups.forPath(&amp;quot;path/to/parent/folder&amp;quot;)] ` can be used to find it and any other objects registered in that folder (whatever their file type).  So you could create your own file type which provides these objects.  
Unless you are doing something very, very unusual, one of the existing registration mechanisms will almost always be sufficient.  
This mechanism may be useful if you have existing code which reads and writes files in some format, and you cannot change that code.
