== How to open files in editor after project creation?

Q: I have created my own project type for my platform application. After project being created I would like to open a file contained in this project. Just like it is done when you create new java application in netbeans. After project creation your main java class is opened in editor.

A: your new project wizard iterator should be a WizardIterator<Set<FileObject>> - and you should just be able to add the files you want opened to that set
