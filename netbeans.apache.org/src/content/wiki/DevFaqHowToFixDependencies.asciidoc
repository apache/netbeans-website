=== My `project.xml` lists more dependencies than I really need. How can I fix it?

As your code evolves, you may find that it no longer needs dependencies on some modules that it used to require.
In this case, you can run the `fix-dependencies` Ant target on your module to remove any unnecessary dependencies from your `project.xml`.

As with any automated modification, it's a good idea to ensure that this file is up-to-date in source control before running this task, although in an emergency you can use the IDE's local history feature to revert changes.
