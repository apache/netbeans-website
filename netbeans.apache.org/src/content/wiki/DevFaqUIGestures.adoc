== DevFaqUIGestures

A perfect tool to get you know users of your application. xref:UIGesturesCollector.adoc[Read more...].

== How should the LogRecords be named

Use link:https://bits.netbeans.org/dev/javadoc/org-openide-util/org/openide/util/doc-files/logging.html[structured logging] e.g. use just a machine name for a log record's message and keep its localized version in a Bundle. Set the logger name to be below the namespace {org.netbeans.ui} in some meaningful subpackage.

The statistic on the server shall then recognize the logger name as well as the message.

== How to verify that my "agent" is logging correctly?

Make sure the interactive gestures collector is installed. Make "Memory" toolbar visible. Execute the action that does the logging. Invoke the icon in the "memory" toolbar and "View Data". Use the combo box to scroll to the right message - which anyway should be somewhere at the bottom of the displayed file.

== How to find out existing logger

They are listed at xref:UIGesturesCollector.adoc[UIGesturesCollector].
