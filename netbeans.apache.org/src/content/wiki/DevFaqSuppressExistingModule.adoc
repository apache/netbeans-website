== I want my module to disable some of the modules that would normally be enabled. Possible?

If you're building a complete application (for example, selecting the *Standalone Application* option for a module suite) just use the *Libraries* panel of the suite's *Properties* dialog to exclude modules you don't need from clusters you are otherwise including.

If you have a single module which you want to install in an existing application (e.g. the NetBeans IDE) and disable another module, it's a little trickier. You can do it in your `ModuleInstall.restored()` method:

Sample:

link:http://hg.netbeans.org/main/file/tip/versioning.system.cvss/src/org/netbeans/modules/versioning/system/cvss/ModuleLifecycleManager.java[ModuleLifecycleManager.java] of the Java CVS Module

You can also go through the Auto Update Services API:

Applies to: NetBeans 6.5 and later
