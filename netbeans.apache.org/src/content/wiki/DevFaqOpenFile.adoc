== Approach 1

Answer from link:http://forums.netbeans.org/topic32140.html&highlight=[this] post:

[source,java]
----

FileObject fo = FileUtil.toFileObject(new File("test.js").getAbsoluteFile()); 
DataObject newDo = DataObject.find(fo); 
final Node node = newDo.getNodeDelegate(); 
Action a = node.getPreferredAction(); 
if (a instanceof ContextAwareAction) { 
       a = ((ContextAwareAction) a).createContextAwareInstance(node.getLookup()); 
} 
if (a != null) { 
      a.actionPerformed(new ActionEvent(node, ActionEvent.ACTION_PERFORMED, "")); // NOI18N 
}
----

Keep in mind that this must be called from the EDT thread, it'll raise a RuntimeException otherwise.

== Approach 2

[source,java]
----

FileObject fileObject=...
DataObject.find(fileObject).getLookup().lookup(OpenCookie.class).open();
----
