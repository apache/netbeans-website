1. Please add entries to the file 'catalog' in this directory when
   adding new DTDs. This will help people using various XML structure
   editing tools to work with your kind of XML file offline. Do not
   forget too that you can register a DTD for use inside the IDE (XML
   module) using the xml/entities/ folder.

2. Avoid editing existing DTDs. Consider making a new DTD instead
   (just increment its number). This will help avoid confusion and
   possible parse errors.

3. See <https://netbeans.apache.org/wiki/VersioningPolicy#XML_DTDs_and_Schemas> for
   further hints.
