<!-- root element of PES configuration
  
  attributes:
  
    incomingDir: where PES expects results to be uploaded
      this directory will have two subdirectories:
        - replacement/
          - results stored in this directory
    	     will replace the already processed
    		 results (if applicable)
    	- invalid/
    	  - here are placed results which cannot
    		 be processes by PES (ivalid or incomplete
    		 archive) - so they can be further 
    		 investigated manually
    		 
    workDir: PES' working directory - used for processing
       results before they are integrated to web
       
    loggingLevel: logging level of PES, which is used for writing out logs
                  to standard output. Default value is WARNING
                  usually there is no need to specify this attribute
                  since 'WARNING' level is suitable for most users
                  
    databaseUploadPath: path, where resuls prepored for database upload. 
                are stored. When this attribute is set, database upload 
                mode is actiavated. More information on this topic will come soon.
                
    team:   default team of this PES instance. This attribute applies only
            when databaseUploadPath is set, hence it is relevant only when
            uploading results to database. Again more informatin on this 
            will be written soon.

<!-- element describing email settings for PES.
  
   This element is optional and when used, PES is able to send notification to 
   it's administrators about exceptional states it encounters. Attributes are:
   
   smtpHost: host address which is running smtp daemon to send email. Unix workstation
             are usually running this daemon. If you are not sure, please
             ask your network administrator.
         
    from:    email account which is used as a sender of this message. 
    to:      email account to which are all messages sent
    loggingLevel: similarly as in the top element (PESConfig), but this logging 
                level is used for sending notifications via email. Usually
                there is no need to define this attribute, since 'SEVERE' level
                is suitable for most users

<!-- element describing PES' web. Any PES instance can manage
	  one or more websites, each is independent on each other
	 - this functionality can be used to prepare archives
	   for offline access or to prepare truncated results
	   (results uploaded to netbeans.org)
	 
  attributes:

    
    webroot: directory in the filesystem which serve as
    	web root for results (does not have to be 
    	real webroot of the http server, but any
    	subdirectory of it).
    	
    type: type of the web. Possible values are:
      - main - main PES web - this is the only compulsory
         web to be specified in the config. All other types
         of web are created from this one. Only one main
         web can exist in one PES instance.
      - copy - full or partial copy of the main web. This
         can be used when preparing subset of results to be
         published on other network (e.g. netbeans.org)
      - archive - web to be archived for offline access. It 
          is actually full or partial copy of main web, but
          results available in archive are deleted from main
          web. If you need to keep them available on the
          main web, use 'copy' value instead of 'archive'     
    
    truncate: setting this to true means, that results
      in this web are truncated - i.e. no working
      directories, IDE userdirs nor exception details
      are available on this web
      
    includeExceptions: when set to true (default), exceptions thrown in the
            tests are displayed with stack traces on the pages. If false, no
            stacktraces are displayed.
            
    includeIDELogs: when set to true (default), ide logs are available from
            the web pages.
            
    uploadToDatabase: if true (default), then results from this web will be uploaded
        to database. This attribute depends on databaseUploadPath in PESConfig,
        so if the databaseUploadPath is not set, then this attribute has no 
        effect at all.            
      
    webURL: URL of the webroot. This attribute is required only when database
            uploads are on (see databaseUploadPath attribute in PESConfig

<!-- this elements defines groups of projects
	 available on the web. Each web can contain
	 one or more projects group. Each project group
	 can include one or more projects and is available
	 on separate page. All group pages are connected 
	 together via links.
	 
  attributes:
  	
  	name: name of the group - this name is displayed
  	  in the title of the main group page as well on 
  	  links pointing to this page
  	  
  	description: detailed description of this group -
  		description is displayed on the group summary page
  		
  	main: if true, this group is taken as the main group
  		on the web site (is available in index.html).
                It also means that all results which does
                not fit into any other group will stay in this

  	currentBuilds: defines number of builds which are
  	  considered as current - they are available
  	  on the first projects summary page. Any build
  	  'older' than the number specified is available
  	  in other page. If not defined - no older builds
          are created
  	
  	detailedData: defines number of builds for which are
  	  detailed data kept available. When a build is older then
  	  defined number, all detailed data (workdirs, logs, IDE userdirs)
  	  are deleted. When not defined, no detailed data are deleted.
          
        uploadToDatabase: this settings applied only when databaseUploadPath
            is set in PESConfig element. Basically this let you to let the results 
            from this group to be uploaded to database, or disables (when set to
            false) the upload of all results from this group

<!-- PESProject defines logical project which is managed
 	 in this group.
 	 
  attributes:
         
    project: real name of the project as is defined
      in the submitted results. This attribute serves
      as 'link' to the tested project (i.e. even
      though on pages is displayed logical names, 
      the shown data are from this project. Attribute
      can contain regular expression (with syntax 
      conforming to JDK 1.4 regex package)
      
    department: from which department should
      be tests included in this project. Usually one real 
      project can be tested by several groups  (like
      QA, Development, RE) and results needs to be
      kept separately. If not defined, all departments
      are included.  Attribute can also contain
      regular expression (with syntax conforming to
      JDK 1.4 regex package)
      
    testType: which test type should be included in this
      project. Similarly as with department - one real
      project can be tested with several test types (e.g.
      functional, performance, unit ...). If this attribute
      is not defined, then all test types are included. 
      Likewise with project and department, testType can 
      contain regular expression.
      
     fromBuild: from which build should be project
       available in this logical project. If not defined,
       all builds from beginning to buildTo are included
       in this logical project.
     
     toBuild: to which build should be project available
       in this logical project. If not defined, all
       builds from buildFrom are included in this
       logical project.
